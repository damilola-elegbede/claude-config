# Agent Coordination User Experience

## Overview

This document defines the user experience principles and patterns for multi-agent coordination in the Claude Configuration Framework. It focuses on making complex agent orchestration intuitive, transparent, and efficient for users across all skill levels.

## Core UX Principles for Agent Coordination

### 1. Transparent Orchestration
Users should understand what agents are doing and why:
- Clear visibility into agent selection rationale
- Real-time progress updates for multi-agent operations
- Explicit communication of dependencies and sequencing

### 2. Intelligent Automation
The system should handle complexity while keeping users in control:
- Automatic agent selection based on task context
- Smart wave-based execution with dependency management
- Graceful degradation when agents fail or timeout

### 3. Progressive Disclosure
Complexity should be revealed only when needed:
- Simple commands that hide multi-agent coordination
- Detailed progress view available on demand
- Expert controls accessible without cluttering basic interface

### 4. Predictable Behavior
Agent coordination should follow consistent patterns:
- Similar tasks use similar agent combinations
- Wave execution follows logical dependency chains
- Error handling and recovery procedures are standardized

## Agent Selection UX Patterns

### Automatic Agent Selection

#### Context-Aware Assignment
The system analyzes task context and automatically selects appropriate agents:

```text
🎯 Task: "Implement user authentication system"

🧠 Agent Selection Analysis:
  - Security requirements detected → security-auditor included
  - Backend API needed → backend-engineer selected
  - Database changes required → database-admin added
  - Frontend integration → frontend-engineer included
  - Testing required → test-engineer assigned

✅ Recommended Agent Team:
  🔒 security-auditor: Security framework and requirements
  ⚙️  backend-engineer: Authentication API implementation
  🗄️  database-admin: User schema and session management
  🎨 frontend-engineer: Login/signup UI components
  🧪 test-engineer: Authentication flow testing
```

#### User Confirmation and Override
Users can review and modify automatic selections:

```text
🎯 Proposed Agent Coordination:

Wave 1 (Foundation):
  ✅ security-auditor: Security requirements analysis
  ✅ database-admin: Schema design and setup

Wave 2 (Implementation):
  ✅ backend-engineer: API development
  ✅ frontend-engineer: UI implementation

Wave 3 (Quality):
  ✅ test-engineer: Comprehensive testing

💡 Suggestions:
  + Add performance-engineer for optimization?
  + Include tech-writer for API documentation?

## Wave Execution UX Patterns

### Wave Visualization

#### Progress Dashboard
Real-time view of multi-wave execution:

```text
🌊 Multi-Agent Execution Dashboard

Wave 1: Foundation and Planning ████████████████ 100% (Complete)
  ✅ security-auditor     Completed in 2m 15s
  ✅ database-admin      Completed in 1m 45s
  ✅ principal-architect  Completed in 3m 20s

Wave 2: Core Implementation ████████████▓▓▓▓ 75% (In Progress)
  ✅ backend-engineer    Completed in 8m 30s
  🔄 frontend-engineer   85% - Building login component
  ⏳ test-engineer       Waiting for frontend completion

Wave 3: Integration and Polish ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ 0% (Queued)
  ⏳ performance-engineer  Waiting for Wave 2
  ⏳ code-reviewer          Waiting for Wave 2
  ⏳ tech-writer            Waiting for Wave 2

📊 Overall Progress: 58% complete
⏱️  Estimated time remaining: 4-6 minutes
🎯 Next milestone: Frontend component completion
```

#### Simplified Progress View
For users who prefer minimal information:

```text
🌊 Authentication System Implementation

✅ Planning and Design      (3 agents, 3m 20s)
🔄 Core Development        (3 agents, ~6 minutes remaining)
⏳ Testing and Polish      (3 agents, queued)

Overall: 58% complete, ~8 minutes remaining
```

### Wave Transition Communication

#### Inter-Wave Handoffs
Clear communication when waves transition:

```text
✅ Wave 1 Complete: Foundation and Planning

📋 Deliverables Ready:
  🔒 Security framework and requirements specification
  🗄️  Database schema with user and session tables
  🏗️  System architecture with authentication flow

🌊 Starting Wave 2: Core Implementation

Agents receiving handoff:
  ⚙️  backend-engineer ← Security requirements + DB schema
  🎨 frontend-engineer ← Security requirements + UI specifications
  🧪 test-engineer ← All specifications for test planning

🔄 Initiating parallel execution...
```

### Error Handling in Multi-Agent Workflows

#### Agent Failure Recovery
When individual agents fail within a wave:

```text
❌ Agent Failure Detected: frontend-engineer

🔍 Issue Analysis:
  - Error: TypeScript compilation failure
  - Impact: Wave 2 cannot complete
  - Dependencies: test-engineer waiting on frontend

🤖 Auto-Recovery Options:
  [1] Retry with relaxed TypeScript settings
  [2] Deploy backup frontend-architect for troubleshooting
  [3] Continue with other agents, manual frontend fix later

⚡ Quick Recovery (Recommended):
  Deploying frontend-architect to diagnose and fix TypeScript issues
  Estimated fix time: 2-3 minutes

[R]etry Auto-Recovery  [M]anual Intervention  [S]kip for Now
```

#### Wave Failure Handling
When entire waves fail or need restructuring:

```text
⚠️ Wave 2 Execution Issues Detected

🔍 Problems Identified:
  - backend-engineer: Database connection timeout
  - frontend-engineer: Dependency conflicts
  - test-engineer: Cannot proceed without implementations

🛠️ Recovery Strategy:
  Option 1: Fix and Retry Wave 2
    ✓ Quick fix for DB connection
    ✓ Resolve frontend dependencies
    ⏱️  Estimated delay: 5-10 minutes

  Option 2: Restructure Workflow
    ✓ Break Wave 2 into smaller sub-waves
    ✓ Address issues incrementally
    ⏱️  Estimated delay: 15-20 minutes

💡 Recommendation: Option 1 (quick fixes likely to resolve)
[F]ix and Retry  [R]estructure  [A]bort and Manual
```

## Error Prevention and Recovery

### Proactive Error Prevention

#### Dependency Validation
Preventing coordination issues before they occur:

```text
🔍 Pre-Execution Validation

Dependency Analysis:
  ✅ All required agents available and healthy
  ✅ Agent compatibility verified
  ✅ Resource requirements within limits
  ⚠️  Potential conflict detected

Conflict Details:
  🔴 backend-engineer and database-admin may conflict on schema changes
  💡 Resolution: Prioritize database-admin for schema design, then backend implementation

Validation Options:
  [A]uto-resolve conflicts (recommended)
  [M]anual coordination planning
  [P]roceed with caution
  [C]ancel and replanning
```

#### Resource Conflict Prevention
Avoiding resource contention issues:

```text
⚡ Resource Conflict Analysis

Potential Issues:
  ⚠️  High memory usage if all agents run simultaneously
  ⚠️  Database lock contention between database-admin and backend-engineer
  ✅ Network bandwidth sufficient for API calls

Optimization Suggestions:
  🔄 Stagger agent execution to reduce peak memory usage
  📅 Schedule database operations during low-conflict periods
  ⚡ Enable resource throttling for non-critical agents
