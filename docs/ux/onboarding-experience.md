### Path 2: Guided Tutorial (30-45 minutes)

#### For Users Who Want Comprehensive Understanding

##### Module 1: Foundation Understanding (10 minutes)

###### Introduction to Core Concepts

```text
🎓 Module 1: Claude Framework Foundations

What Makes Claude Special:
  🤖 28 Specialized AI Agents
    Each agent is an expert in specific development areas
    Example: backend-engineer, frontend-engineer, security-auditor

  🌊 Wave-Based Orchestration
    Agents work in coordinated waves for maximum efficiency
    Wave 1: Planning → Wave 2: Implementation → Wave 3: Quality

  ⚡ Parallel Execution
    Multiple agents work simultaneously
    4-6x faster than traditional development

  🛡️ Built-in Quality Gates
    Every operation includes appropriate quality checks
    Security, performance, accessibility automatically validated

Interactive Demo:
  Let's see this in action with a real example...

  Task: "Add user authentication to web app"

  🌊 Wave 1: Planning (Parallel execution)
    security-auditor: Authentication security requirements
    database-admin: User schema and session management
    ui-designer: Login/signup interface design

  🌊 Wave 2: Implementation (Parallel execution)
    backend-engineer: Authentication API endpoints
    frontend-engineer: Login/signup components
    test-engineer: Authentication testing suite

  🌊 Wave 3: Quality Assurance (Parallel execution)
    security-auditor: Security vulnerability testing
    accessibility-auditor: Login form accessibility
    performance-engineer: Authentication performance

  Result: Complete, secure, tested authentication system
  Time: 45 minutes vs 6-8 hours traditional approach
```

###### Hands-On Exercise 1: Basic Commands

```bash
# Try the essential commands
/agent-audit     # See all available agents
/prime          # Analyze current project
/help           # Explore command options

# Your turn: Run these commands and observe the output
# Notice how each command provides rich, actionable information
```

##### Module 2: Agent Coordination (15 minutes)

###### Understanding Multi-Agent Workflows

```text
🎭 Module 2: Agent Coordination Mastery

Agent Selection Principles:
  🎯 Task-Appropriate Agents
    Frontend work → frontend-engineer, ui-designer
    Backend work → backend-engineer, database-admin
    Quality focus → test-engineer, security-auditor

  ⚡ Parallelization Opportunities
    Independent tasks run simultaneously
    Dependent tasks wait for prerequisites

  🌊 Wave Coordination
    Wave planning based on logical dependencies
    Maximum parallel execution within each wave

Real Example: Building a React Component
```

###### Hands-On Exercise 2: Feature Implementation

```bash
# Let's implement a real feature together
/implement "responsive navigation component with mobile menu"

# Watch the agent coordination:
# 1. ui-designer creates design specifications
# 2. frontend-engineer implements React component
# 3. test-engineer creates test suite
# 4. accessibility-auditor validates WCAG compliance

# This would typically take 2-3 hours
# With Claude: 15-20 minutes with higher quality
```

##### Module 3: Workflow Integration (10 minutes)

###### Daily Development Workflows

```text
🔄 Module 3: Daily Development Workflows

Common Development Patterns:

Morning Routine:
  /prime --comprehensive     # Daily project health check
  /agent-audit              # Ensure all systems ready
  /plan "today's tasks"     # Intelligent task planning

Feature Development:
  /implement "feature description" --tests --docs
  /review --comprehensive   # Multi-agent quality review
  /commit                  # Smart commit with semantic message
  /push                    # Safe deployment

Bug Investigation:
  /debug "issue description"
  /implement "fix description" --focused
  /test --regression       # Ensure fix doesn't break anything

Quality Assurance:
  /review --security       # Security-focused review
  /test --coverage         # Comprehensive test coverage
  /docs --update          # Keep documentation current
```

###### Hands-On Exercise 3: Complete Workflow

```bash
# Practice a complete development workflow
/plan "Add user profile edit functionality"
# → Follow the suggested implementation plan

/implement "user profile edit form with validation"
# → Watch multi-agent coordination

/review --comprehensive
# → See quality analysis across multiple dimensions

/commit
# → Experience intelligent commit message generation

# Reflect on the experience:
# - How much time did this save?
# - What quality improvements did you notice?
# - Which agents were most helpful?
