# User-Centered Design Guide for Claude Framework

## Overview

This guide establishes user-centered design principles and methodologies for the Claude Configuration Framework. It provides a comprehensive approach to designing features, interfaces, and workflows that prioritize user needs, reduce friction, and enhance the overall developer experience.

## Core User-Centered Design Principles

### 1. User Needs First
Every design decision starts with understanding user problems:
- Conduct user research before implementing features
- Validate assumptions through user testing and feedback
- Prioritize user value over technical elegance

### 2. Cognitive Load Minimization
Reduce mental effort required for task completion:
- Simplify complex workflows through intelligent defaults
- Provide clear information hierarchy and progressive disclosure
- Minimize context switching and memory requirements

### 3. Feedback and Transparency
Users should always understand system state and next steps:
- Provide immediate feedback for all user actions
- Explain system behavior and decision-making processes
- Offer clear guidance for error recovery and optimization

### 4. Accessibility and Inclusion
Design for diverse users and abilities:
- Support multiple interaction modalities (visual, auditory, keyboard)
- Accommodate different skill levels and experience
- Consider cultural and linguistic diversity
