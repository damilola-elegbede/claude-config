# Interface Guidelines: Claude Framework Command Design

## Overview

This document establishes comprehensive interface design principles for the Claude Configuration Framework.
These guidelines ensure consistent, intuitive, and efficient user interactions across all commands, agents, and
system responses.

## Core Design Principles

### 1. Clarity Over Cleverness

Every interface element should be immediately understandable:

- Use descriptive command names that clearly indicate functionality
- Provide unambiguous parameter names and options
- Offer explicit feedback rather than implicit system state

### 2. Progressive Enhancement

Support users at all skill levels:

- Simple commands work with sensible defaults
- Advanced options available through clear parameters
- Expert features accessible without compromising basic usability

### 3. Predictable Patterns

Consistent behavior across the framework:

- Similar commands follow identical interaction patterns
- Error handling and recovery procedures are standardized
- Success and failure states provide predictable feedback

### 4. Cognitive Load Minimization

Reduce mental effort required for task completion:

- Group related functionality logically
- Minimize required memorization through good defaults
- Provide contextual help and guidance

## Command Interface Standards

### Command Naming Conventions

#### Primary Commands (Core Workflows)

Use action verbs that clearly describe the primary function:

```bash
/sync       # Synchronize configurations
/test       # Execute testing workflows
/commit     # Intelligent git commit process
/review     # Code quality review
/implement  # Feature implementation
/debug      # Bug investigation and resolution
```

#### Utility Commands (Supporting Functions)

Use descriptive nouns or noun-verb combinations:

```bash
/agent-audit    # Validate agent ecosystem health
/prime         # Repository analysis and preparation
/docs          # Documentation generation
/plan          # Project planning and strategy
```

#### Administrative Commands (System Management)

Use administrative terminology:

```bash
/fix-ci        # CI/CD pipeline repair
/deps          # Dependency management
/ship-it       # Production deployment
```

### Parameter Design Standards

#### Flag Conventions

- Use `--` for long-form options: `--dry-run`, `--verbose`, `--force`
- Use `-` for single-character shortcuts: `-v`, `-f`, `-h`
- Boolean flags don't require values: `--dry-run` not `--dry-run=true`

#### Parameter Naming

- Use descriptive names: `--target-environment` not `--env`
- Separate words with hyphens: `--max-retry-count` not `--maxRetryCount`
- Avoid abbreviations unless universally understood: `--config` ok, `--cfg` avoid

#### Example Parameter Patterns

```bash
# Good: Clear and descriptive
/implement "User authentication system" --tests --security-audit --docs

# Good: Logical flag grouping
/test --unit --integration --coverage-report

# Good: Sensible defaults with override options
/review --scope=all --quality-threshold=90 --auto-fix
```

### Help and Documentation Integration

#### Inline Help Standards

Every command must provide:

- Brief description of primary function
- Parameter list with explanations
- Usage examples for common scenarios
- Related commands for workflow continuity

#### Help Format Template

```bash
/command-name --help

Description:
  Brief explanation of command purpose and primary use cases

Usage:
  /command-name [options] [arguments]

Options:
  --primary-option    Primary configuration option with sensible default
  --advanced-option   Advanced feature for expert users
  --help             Show this help message

Examples:
  /command-name                           # Basic usage with defaults
  /command-name --advanced-option value   # Advanced usage example

Related Commands:
  /related-command    Brief description of relationship

```

## Response and Feedback Standards

## Agent Coordination Interface

### Agent Selection and Status

#### Agent Health Display

```text
🎭 Agent Ecosystem Status:

Development Agents:
  ✅ backend-engineer    Ready (last used: 2 min ago)
  ✅ frontend-engineer   Ready
  ✅ mobile-engineer     Ready
  ⚠️  fullstack-lead     Warning (high memory usage)

Quality Agents:
  ✅ test-engineer       Ready
  ✅ security-auditor    Ready
  ✅ code-reviewer       Ready

Infrastructure:
  ✅ devops             Ready
  ❌ platform-engineer  Error (configuration issue)

💡 Recommendations:
  - Monitor fullstack-lead memory usage
  - Reconfigure platform-engineer (see /agent-audit --detailed)
```

#### Multi-Agent Coordination Display

```text
🌊 Wave 1: Foundation Analysis (Parallel execution)
  🔄 principal-architect: System architecture design
  🔄 security-auditor: Security requirements analysis
  🔄 database-admin: Data architecture planning
  ✅ ui-designer: Design system specification

🌊 Wave 2: Implementation (Waiting for Wave 1)
  ⏳ backend-engineer-1: API endpoint implementation

```

## Accessibility and Inclusion

### Visual Accessibility

#### Color Usage Standards

- Never rely solely on color to convey information
- Use icons and text labels alongside color coding
- Provide high contrast alternatives for status indicators

#### Status Indicators

```text
Status indicators use multiple visual cues:
✅ Success (green checkmark + "Success" text)
❌ Error (red X + "Error" text)
⚠️ Warning (yellow triangle + "Warning" text)
🔄 In Progress (blue circle + "Processing" text)
```

### Cognitive Accessibility

#### Information Architecture

- Present information in logical, scannable hierarchy
- Use consistent terminology throughout interface
- Provide clear navigation and orientation cues

#### Language Clarity

- Use plain language, avoid technical jargon when possible
- Define technical terms when necessary
- Provide context for complex operations

### Motor Accessibility

#### Command Shortcuts

Provide efficient alternatives for common operations:

```bash
# Common shortcuts
/s      # Alias for /sync
/t      # Alias for /test
/c      # Alias for /commit
/r      # Alias for /review

# Tab completion for all commands and parameters
/impl<TAB> → /implement
--dry<TAB> → --dry-run
```

## Performance and Responsiveness

### Response Time Standards

#### Immediate Feedback (< 100ms)

- Command parsing and validation
- Help text display
- Basic status queries

#### Quick Operations (< 1 second)

- File synchronization
- Simple validation checks
- Agent health queries

#### Standard Operations (1-5 seconds)

- Repository analysis
- Single-agent tasks
- Quality gate validation

#### Complex Operations (5-30 seconds)

- Multi-agent coordination
- Comprehensive testing
- Full project implementation

### Loading State Management

#### Progressive Loading

For operations that take longer than 2 seconds:

1. **Immediate acknowledgment** (< 100ms)
2. **Activity indication** (animated progress)
3. **Detailed progress** (stage-by-stage updates)
4. **Completion confirmation** (results summary)

#### Cancellation Support

All long-running operations should support graceful cancellation:

```text
🔄 Processing... (Press Ctrl+C to cancel)

Operation cancelled by user
🔄 Cleaning up partial results...
✅ Cleanup completed - system state restored
```

## Error Prevention and Recovery

### Proactive Error Prevention

#### Input Validation

- Validate command syntax before execution
- Check prerequisites and dependencies
- Warn about potentially destructive operations

#### Smart Defaults

- Provide safe, reversible defaults for all operations
- Offer confirmation prompts for significant changes
- Auto-backup before destructive operations

### Error Recovery Guidance

#### Recovery Action Hierarchy

1. **Automatic Recovery**: System resolves issue without user intervention
2. **Guided Recovery**: System provides specific steps for user action
3. **Manual Recovery**: User must investigate and resolve independently

#### Recovery Message Template

```text
❌ Error: [Specific issue description]

🤖 Automatic Recovery:
  ✅ Temporary files cleaned up
  ✅ Configuration state restored
  ⏳ Retrying operation with adjusted parameters...

If automatic recovery fails:
🛠️ Manual Steps:
  1. [Specific action]
  2. [Verification step]
  3. [Retry command]

🔍 For detailed diagnosis: /debug "[error context]"
```
