# Command Interaction Patterns

## Overview

This document defines optimal interaction patterns for Claude framework commands, focusing on user efficiency, discoverability, and workflow continuity. These patterns ensure consistent, intuitive command usage across all user skill levels.

## Core Interaction Principles

### 1. Natural Language Mapping
Commands should feel natural and intuitive:
- Use familiar development terminology
- Map to existing mental models from git, npm, and common CLI tools
- Provide clear semantic relationships between related commands

### 2. Workflow Continuity
Commands should connect logically in common workflows:
- Previous command output informs next command suggestions
- Related commands are easily discoverable
- Workflow state is preserved across command sequences

### 3. Contextual Intelligence
Commands adapt to current project and user context:
- Automatic parameter inference from project state
- Smart defaults based on repository analysis
- Context-aware help and suggestions

### 4. Graceful Escalation
Simple commands can escalate to complex operations smoothly:
- Basic commands work with minimal parameters
- Advanced options available through clear flags
- Expert features accessible without breaking simple workflows

## Command Discovery Patterns

### Help and Documentation Integration

#### Contextual Help System
Commands provide immediate assistance without breaking workflow:

```bash
# Inline help for any command
/sync --help
/implement --help
/test --help

# Context-aware suggestions
/implement "user auth"
💡 Suggestion: Add --security-audit flag for authentication features
💡 Related: /review --security after implementation

# Quick examples for common use cases
/test --examples
Example 1: /test                    # Run all tests
Example 2: /test --unit --watch     # Unit tests with file watching
Example 3: /test --coverage         # Generate coverage report
```

#### Command Discovery Flow
Progressive discovery of framework capabilities:

```

### Autocomplete and Suggestions

#### Intelligent Command Completion
Smart completion based on context and history:

```bash
# Command name completion
/imp<TAB> → /implement
/ag<TAB>  → /agent-audit

# Parameter completion with context awareness
/implement "user dashboard" --<TAB>
Options: --tests --security-audit --docs --mobile --performance

# File and path completion
/review src/<TAB>
Options: components/ hooks/ utils/ types/

# Historical command completion
/implement "user auth<TAB>
Recent: "user authentication system"
Recent: "user authorization middleware"
Recent: "user auth with OAuth2"
```

#### Smart Parameter Suggestions
Context-aware parameter recommendations:

```text
🧠 Smart Parameter Logic

Project Context Analysis:
  - React project detected → suggest --components flag
  - TypeScript detected → suggest --types flag
  - Testing framework found → suggest --tests flag
  - Security features needed → suggest --security-audit

Recent Usage Patterns:
  - User frequently uses --docs → auto-suggest documentation
  - Performance focus → suggest --optimization flags
  - Team collaboration → suggest --review flags

Quality Requirements:
  - High-security project → always suggest security validation
  - Performance-critical app → suggest performance testing
  - Public-facing app → suggest accessibility audits
```

## Command Composition Patterns

### Command Chaining and Workflows

#### Natural Workflow Sequences
Commands that naturally follow each other in development workflows:

```bash
# Feature Development Workflow
/implement "user profile settings" --tests --docs
# ↓ Natural next step suggested
💡 Next: /review --comprehensive to validate implementation

/review --comprehensive
# ↓ If review passes
💡 Next: /commit to save changes with semantic message

/commit
# ↓ After successful commit
💡 Next: /push to deploy to staging environment

# Bug Fix Workflow
/debug "login fails on mobile"
# ↓ After identifying issue
💡 Next: /implement "fix mobile login issue" --security-check

# Quality Assurance Workflow
/test --coverage
# ↓ If coverage below threshold
💡 Next: /implement --tests-only to improve coverage
```

#### Command Pipeline Patterns
Commands that can be efficiently combined:

```bash
# Pipeline with automatic progression
/implement "payment integration" && /test --integration && /review --security

# Conditional progression based on results
/test || /debug "test failures"

# Quality gate enforcement
/implement "feature" --require-tests --require-docs --require-review

# Batch operations
/sync && /prime && /agent-audit  # Setup and validation sequence
```

### Parameter Pattern Consistency

#### Consistent Flag Patterns
Standardized parameter patterns across commands:

```bash
# Quality and validation flags (consistent across commands)
--tests          # Include testing
--docs           # Include documentation
--security       # Include security validation
--performance    # Include performance optimization
--accessibility  # Include accessibility compliance

# Execution control flags
--dry-run        # Preview without execution
--verbose        # Detailed output
--quiet          # Minimal output
--force          # Skip confirmations
--watch          # Monitor for changes

# Scope and targeting flags
--scope=path     # Limit to specific directory
--exclude=pattern # Exclude specific files/patterns
--include=pattern # Include specific files/patterns
--parallel=N     # Control parallelization
```

#### Parameter Value Patterns
Consistent value formats and validation:

```bash
# Boolean flags (no value required)
/test --watch --verbose --coverage

# String values with validation
/implement "feature description" --priority=high
# Valid priorities: low, medium, high, critical

# Numeric values with ranges
/test --parallel=4 --timeout=300
# parallel: 1-8, timeout: 30-600 seconds

# File path values with completion
/review --config=.reviewrc --output=reports/review.json

# Multiple values support
/implement "feature" --agents=backend-engineer,test-engineer --tags=auth,security
```

## Error Prevention and Recovery

### Proactive Error Prevention

#### Input Validation Patterns
Comprehensive validation before command execution:

```text
🛡️ Input Validation Framework

Syntax Validation:
  ✅ Command exists and is properly formatted
  ✅ Required parameters provided
  ✅ Parameter values within valid ranges
  ❌ Invalid: /implement --parallel=20 (max: 8)

Context Validation:
  ✅ Prerequisites met (e.g., repository initialized)
  ✅ Required tools available (e.g., git, node)
  ✅ Permissions sufficient for operation
  ❌ Invalid: /push without git remote configured

Semantic Validation:
  ✅ Task description clear and actionable
  ✅ Agent selection appropriate for task
  ✅ Resource requirements within limits
  ❌ Invalid: /implement "" (empty description)

Safety Validation:
  ⚠️  Potentially destructive operations flagged
  ⚠️  Large scope operations confirmed
  ⚠️  Unusual parameter combinations questioned
  Example: /implement "rewrite entire app" → confirmation required
```

#### Safe Defaults and Confirmations
Protecting users from unintended consequences:

```bash
# Safe defaults for potentially destructive operations
/fix-ci --backup  # Automatic backup before CI fixes
/sync --dry-run   # Preview changes before syncing

# Confirmation prompts for significant operations
/implement "database migration"
⚠️  This will modify database schema. Continue? [y/N]

/ship-it production
⚠️  This will deploy to production environment.
🔍 Review changes: 15 files modified, 3 new features
Continue? [y/N]

# Undo/rollback capabilities
/sync --rollback  # Restore previous configuration
/commit --amend   # Modify last commit
```

### Error Recovery Patterns

#### Graceful Error Handling
Clear error communication with actionable recovery steps:

```text
❌ Command Error Recovery Pattern

Error Identification:
  🔍 Clear description of what went wrong
  📊 Context about when and where error occurred
  🎯 Impact assessment of the failure

Root Cause Analysis:
  🔬 Technical explanation in user-friendly terms
  📋 Specific conditions that led to the error
  💡 Similar issues and common causes

Recovery Actions:
  🛠️  Immediate steps user can take
  🔄 Automatic recovery options available
  📖 Documentation links for complex issues

Prevention Guidance:
  💡 How to avoid this error in the future
  ⚙️  Configuration changes to prevent recurrence

Example Error Recovery:
❌ Error: /implement failed - TypeScript compilation error

🔍 Issue: Type definition conflict in user authentication module
📊 Location: src/auth/types.ts, line 15
🎯 Impact: Implementation cannot proceed

🛠️  Quick Fix Options:
  1. /debug "typescript errors" for detailed analysis
  2. /implement --skip-types to continue without type checking
