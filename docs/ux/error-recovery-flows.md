```

### Guided Recovery (Level 2)

#### Interactive Problem-Solving

For moderately complex issues requiring user decisions:

```text
🎯 Guided Recovery Example: TypeScript Compilation Errors

Error Context:
  ❌ Command: /implement "user authentication"
  🔍 Issue: TypeScript compilation failed with type errors
  📊 Complexity: Moderate (requires understanding of types)
  ⏱️  Expected Resolution: 5-10 minutes

Interactive Diagnosis:
  Step 1: Error Analysis
    🔍 Found 3 type errors in authentication module
    📊 Errors involve: interface definitions, generic constraints
    💡 Suggestion: Type system knowledge helpful but not required

  Step 2: Resolution Strategy Selection
    [A] Auto-fix common type issues (Recommended for beginners)
    [B] Guided manual fixing (Learn TypeScript best practices)
    [C] Deploy type specialist agent (Expert assistance)
    [D] Skip type checking temporarily (Continue with warnings)

  Step 3: Chosen Path Execution
    [User selects B - Guided manual fixing]

    🎓 Learning Mode: TypeScript Type Resolution

    Error 1/3: Interface property mismatch
    📍 Location: src/auth/types.ts:15
    🔍 Issue: Property 'role' is missing in User interface

    Fix Options:
    [1] Add 'role: string' to User interface
    [2] Make 'role' optional with 'role?: string'
    [3] Remove role usage from authentication logic

    💡 Educational Context:
    TypeScript interfaces define the shape of objects. When code expects
    a property that isn't defined in the interface, it causes a type error.

    Recommendation: Option 1 (add required property)
    Reason: Role is essential for authentication logic

  Step 4: Guided Implementation
    [User selects option 1]

    ✅ Applied fix: Added 'role: string' to User interface
    🔄 Re-running TypeScript compilation...
    ✅ Error 1/3 resolved
