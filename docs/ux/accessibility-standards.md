# Accessibility Standards for Claude Framework

## Overview

This document establishes comprehensive accessibility standards for the Claude Configuration Framework, ensuring inclusive design that accommodates users with diverse abilities, technical contexts, and interaction preferences. These standards support universal access while maintaining the framework's productivity and efficiency benefits.

## Accessibility Philosophy

### 1. Universal Design Principles

Design for the widest possible range of users from the start:

- Consider accessibility in initial design, not as an afterthought
- Create solutions that benefit all users, not just those with specific needs
- Embrace diversity in abilities, contexts, and interaction methods

### 2. Multiple Pathways to Success

Provide alternative methods for achieving the same outcomes:

- Visual, auditory, and tactile interaction options
- Keyboard, mouse, voice, and touch input support
- Multiple representation formats for information

### 3. Inclusive Technology Integration

Seamlessly support assistive technologies:

- Screen readers and voice synthesis
- Alternative input devices and switches
- Magnification and high contrast tools
- Voice recognition and control systems

### 4. Progressive Enhancement

Build accessibility into every layer:

- Core functionality accessible by default
- Enhanced experiences available with advanced technology
- Graceful degradation when accessibility features are unavailable

## Cognitive Accessibility Standards

### Clear Communication and Information Architecture

#### Language and Content Clarity

Making complex technical information accessible:

```text
üß† Cognitive Accessibility Standards

Plain Language Principles:
  Simple Vocabulary:
    Use common words instead of technical jargon
    Define technical terms when necessary
    Provide glossary for complex concepts

    Example Transformations:
    "Initialize repository analysis" ‚Üí "Start analyzing your project"
    "Deploy multi-agent coordination" ‚Üí "Start multiple AI assistants"
    "Execute quality validation gates" ‚Üí "Check code quality"

  Clear Sentence Structure:
    Active voice preferred over passive
    One idea per sentence
    Short sentences (15-20 words maximum)
    Logical order and flow

    Before: "The implementation will be executed by the backend-engineer agent after security requirements have been analyzed"
    After: "First, we'll analyze security requirements. Then the backend-engineer will implement the feature."

Content Organization:
  Logical Information Hierarchy:
    Most important information first
    Related information grouped together
    Progressive disclosure of complexity
    Clear relationships between concepts

  Scannable Content:
    Descriptive headings and subheadings
    Bullet points for lists
    Short paragraphs with clear topics
    Visual breaks between sections

  Consistent Terminology:
    Same word for same concept throughout
    Avoid synonyms that might confuse
    Maintain consistent naming conventions

    Examples:
    "agent" not "assistant" or "specialist" interchangeably
    "command" not "instruction" or "directive" interchangeably
    "wave" not "phase" or "stage" interchangeably

Error Messages and Instructions:
  Helpful Error Communication:
    What went wrong (clear description)
    Why it happened (context and cause)
    How to fix it (specific steps)
    How to prevent it (future guidance)

    Example Error Message:
    ‚ùå Command failed: Missing project configuration

    What happened: The command needs project settings to work properly
    Why: No package.json or project config file found
    Fix: Run 'npm init' to create a project, or navigate to an existing project
    Prevent: Always run Claude commands from inside a project directory

  Step-by-Step Instructions:
    Number steps clearly
    One action per step
    Expected results for each step
    Visual confirmations where possible

    Example Instructions:
    1. Open your terminal or command prompt
    2. Navigate to your project folder: cd my-project
    3. Run the sync command: /sync
    4. Look for "‚úÖ Sync completed successfully" message
    5. You're ready to use Claude framework!
