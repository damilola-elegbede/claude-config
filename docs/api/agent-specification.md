```

## Agent Coordination Patterns

### Parallel Execution Pattern

```yaml
execution_pattern: "parallel"
use_case: "Independent tasks that can run simultaneously"
examples:
  - Multiple backend-engineer instances for different microservices
  - Quality gates (code-reviewer + security-auditor + test-engineer)
  - Multi-platform development (iOS + Android + Web)
coordination_method: "Result aggregation after completion"
```

**Implementation**:
```yaml
agents:
  - name: backend-engineer
    instance: service-1
    task: authentication_service
  - name: backend-engineer
    instance: service-2
    task: payment_service
  - name: backend-engineer
    instance: service-3
    task: notification_service
aggregation: project-orchestrator
```

### Sequential Pipeline Pattern

```yaml
execution_pattern: "sequential"
use_case: "Dependent tasks requiring ordered execution"
examples:
  - Architecture design → Implementation → Testing
  - Database migration planning → Execution → Validation
  - Security assessment → Remediation → Compliance verification
coordination_method: "Hand-off between stages"
```

**Implementation**:
```yaml
pipeline:
  stage_1:
    agent: principal-architect
    task: system_design
    output: architecture_specifications
  stage_2:
    agent: backend-engineer
    task: implementation
    input: architecture_specifications
    output: implemented_system
  stage_3:
    agent: test-engineer
    task: validation
    input: implemented_system
    output: test_results
```

### Hub-and-Spoke Pattern

```yaml
execution_pattern: "coordinated"
use_case: "Complex multi-agent scenarios requiring orchestration"
central_coordinator: project-orchestrator
spoke_agents:
  - Multiple specialists working on related tasks
  - Regular coordination and synchronization
  - Conflict resolution through coordinator
```

**Implementation**:
```yaml
coordinator: project-orchestrator
agents:
  - backend-engineer: API development
  - frontend-architect: UI implementation
  - mobile-platform-engineer: Mobile app
  - test-engineer: Quality validation
  - security-auditor: Security assessment
coordination_frequency: "After each major milestone"
```

## Command Integration API

### Direct Command Mapping

Commands can directly invoke specific agents:

```yaml
command_mappings:
  "/test": "test-engineer"
  "/review": "code-reviewer"
  "/security": "security-auditor"
  "/perf": "performance-specialist"
  "/docs": "tech-writer"
  "/debug": "debugger"
  "/prime": "codebase-analyst"
```

### Multi-Agent Command Patterns

Commands can trigger multi-agent workflows:

```yaml
complex_commands:
  "/agent-audit":
    pattern: parallel
    agents:
      - type: code-reviewer
        instances: 8
        distribution: by_category
    aggregation: comprehensive_report

  "/resolve-cr":
    pattern: sequential
    pipeline:
      - codebase-analyst: analyze_pr_context
      - appropriate_specialist: implement_changes
      - test-engineer: validate_changes
      - code-reviewer: final_review
```

## Quality Gates API

### Pre-Commit Quality Gates

  code_quality:
    agent: code-reviewer
    criteria:
      - style_compliance: ">= 8.5/10"
      - complexity_score: "< 10"
      - maintainability: ">= 8/10"

  security_check:
    agent: security-auditor
    criteria:
      - vulnerability_scan: "zero_critical"
      - dependency_scan: "zero_high_risk"

  test_validation:
    agent: test-engineer
    criteria:
      - coverage: ">= 80%"
      - passing_tests: "100%"
```

### Deployment Quality Gates

```yaml

  performance_validation:
    agent: performance-specialist
    criteria:
      - response_time: "< 200ms P95"
      - throughput: ">= baseline"
      - memory_usage: "< 80% capacity"

  security_clearance:
    agent: security-auditor
    criteria:
      - penetration_test: "passed"
      - compliance_check: "100%"
      - audit_trail: "complete"

    detection: "Output validation failure"
    recovery: "Request clarification"
    fallback: "Claude intervention"

  tool_access_denied:
    detection: "Permission error"
    recovery: "Escalate to Claude"
    fallback: "Manual override with user consent"

  resource_exhaustion:
    detection: "Memory or CPU limits exceeded"
    recovery: "Reduce scope, retry"
    fallback: "Sequential execution"
```

### Recovery Strategies

```yaml

  automatic:
    - Simple retry logic
    - Alternative agent deployment
    - Scope reduction

  semi_automatic:
    - User notification with options
    - Fallback suggestions
