# Agent Coordination Patterns Guide

## Overview

This comprehensive guide covers advanced patterns for coordinating multiple agents in the Claude Configuration Framework. Learn how to orchestrate complex workflows using wave-based deployment, parallel execution, and intelligent task delegation for maximum efficiency and quality.

## Core Coordination Principles

### Wave-Based Orchestration

The foundation of effective agent coordination is **wave-based deployment**, where agents are organized into execution waves based on dependencies and parallelization opportunities.

```yaml
Wave Pattern Architecture:
  Wave 1: Foundation and Analysis
    - Independent agents that can execute immediately
    - No dependencies on other agents' outputs
    - Parallel execution for maximum efficiency

  Wave 2: Implementation and Development
    - Agents dependent on Wave 1 outputs
    - Parallel execution within the wave
    - Cross-functional coordination

  Wave 3: Integration and Testing
    - Agents requiring completed implementations
    - Quality assurance and validation
    - Performance optimization and refinement

  Wave N: Deployment and Monitoring
    - Final deployment and monitoring setup
    - Documentation and knowledge transfer
    - Continuous improvement feedback loops
```

### Parallel Execution Strategies

#### Multi-Instance Deployment

Deploy multiple instances of the same agent type for different components or aspects of a project:

```yaml
Performance Improvements:
  Single Agent Approach: Sequential processing (N × time per task)
  Multi-Instance Approach: Parallel processing (max(time per task))

Expected Gains:
  - 4-6x faster for homogeneous tasks
  - 3-4x faster for heterogeneous tasks
  - 2-3x faster for dependent tasks with proper wave coordination
```

## Coordination Anti-Patterns

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

#### 1. Sequential Agent Assignment

```yaml
❌ Anti-Pattern: Sequential Processing
  Wave 1: backend-engineer completes entire backend

  Wave 3: test-engineer tests completed application

  Problems:
    - Massive time inefficiency (3-4x slower)
    - Late discovery of integration issues
    - No parallel optimization opportunities
    - Reduced quality through delayed testing
```

```yaml
✅ Correct Pattern: Parallel Development with Coordination
  Wave 1: Architecture and Foundation
    - principal-architect: System design
    - api-architect: API contracts and specifications

  Wave 2: Parallel Implementation
    - backend-engineer: API development following contracts
    - frontend-engineer: UI development with mock APIs
    - test-engineer: Test development parallel to implementation

  Wave 3: Integration and Testing
    - test-engineer: Integration testing with real APIs
    - performance-engineer: Performance optimization
    - security-auditor: Security validation
```

#### 2. Agent Role Confusion

```yaml
❌ Anti-Pattern: Wrong Agent for Task
  Task: "Implement authentication system"
  Agent: frontend-engineer

  Problems:
    - frontend-engineer lacks backend security expertise
    - Incomplete security implementation
    - Performance and scalability issues
    - Compliance and audit trail gaps
```

```yaml
✅ Correct Pattern: Appropriate Agent Selection
  Task: "Implement authentication system"

  Wave 1: Security Architecture
    - security-auditor: Security requirements and architecture
    - principal-architect: System integration and scalability design

  Wave 2: Implementation
    - backend-engineer: Secure authentication API implementation
    - frontend-engineer: Authentication UI and user experience

  Wave 3: Validation
    - security-auditor: Security testing and vulnerability assessment
    - test-engineer: Authentication flow testing and edge cases
```

#### 3. Insufficient Coordination

```yaml
❌ Anti-Pattern: Independent Agent Work
  Agents working in isolation without communication or shared understanding

  Problems:
    - Design-implementation mismatches
    - Inconsistent technical decisions
    - Integration difficulties
    - Duplicated or conflicting work
```

```yaml
✅ Correct Pattern: Coordinated Collaboration
  Coordination Mechanisms:
    - Shared technical specifications and contracts
    - Regular cross-functional checkpoints
    - Common design systems and standards
    - Integrated testing and validation processes
```
