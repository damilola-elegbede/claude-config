```

### Integration Patterns

#### Working with ui-designer

```yaml
Coordination Pattern: Design-to-Implementation
Workflow:
  1. ui-designer creates component specifications and design tokens
  2. frontend-engineer implements components following design system
  3. ux-researcher validates accessibility and usability
  4. frontend-engineer iterates based on feedback
```

#### Working with backend-engineer

```yaml
API Integration Pattern:
Workflow:
  1. backend-engineer provides API specifications
  2. frontend-engineer generates TypeScript types from OpenAPI
  3. Parallel development of frontend and backend features
  4. Integration testing with real API endpoints
```

## Frontend-Architect Usage Patterns

### When to Engage frontend-architect

- **Large-scale applications** requiring architectural decisions
- **Micro-frontend** implementations across teams
- **Performance architecture** for high-traffic applications
- **Design system architecture** at enterprise scale

### Architectural Decisions

#### 1. Micro-Frontend Architecture

```bash
Task: "Design micro-frontend architecture for e-commerce platform with independent team deployment"

Architecture Components:

- Shared design system distribution
- Cross-app communication patterns
- Independent CI/CD pipelines per micro-frontend
```

#### 2. State Management Architecture

```bash
Task: "Design scalable state management for complex dashboard application with real-time data"

Solution Approach:
- Domain-driven state organization
- Real-time data synchronization patterns
- Optimistic updates with rollback
- Caching strategies for performance
```

## UI-Designer Integration

  2. frontend-engineer: Implements components with exact design specifications
  3. frontend-architect: Ensures scalable component architecture
  4. ux-researcher: Validates accessibility compliance
```

### Design-to-Code Workflow

```yaml
Process:
  Design Phase:
    - ui-designer creates Figma designs with design tokens

    - Adds comprehensive testing

  Validation Phase:
    - ux-researcher conducts usability testing
    - accessibility-auditor validates WCAG compliance
    - frontend-engineer iterates based on feedback
```

## Mobile-Engineer Coordination

### Cross-Platform Development

#### React Native Projects

```bash

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

#### 1. Single Agent Overload

```bash
❌ Bad Pattern:
Task: "Create entire e-commerce frontend including design, architecture, implementation, and testing"
Agent: frontend-engineer

Problem: Single agent overwhelmed with multi-disciplinary responsibilities
```

```bash
✅ Good Pattern:
Architecture: frontend-architect
Design: ui-designer
Implementation: frontend-engineer (multiple instances for parallel development)
Testing: test-engineer
UX Validation: ux-researcher
```

#### 2. Insufficient Coordination

```bash
❌ Bad Pattern:
Parallel development without coordination:
- frontend-engineer builds components
- ui-designer creates designs
- No synchronization between design and implementation

Result: Design-implementation mismatch and rework
```

```bash
✅ Good Pattern:
Coordinated workflow:
1. ui-designer creates component specifications
2. frontend-engineer implements following exact specifications
3. Regular design reviews and feedback loops
4. Shared design token system for consistency
```

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

#### Design-Implementation Mismatch

```yaml
Symptoms:
- Components don't match designs
- Inconsistent spacing and typography
- Missing interactive states

Solution:
  1. Establish design token system early
  2. Use ui-designer for component specifications
  3. frontend-engineer implements with design system
  4. Regular cross-functional reviews
```

#### Performance Regression

```yaml
Symptoms:
- Bundle size increases
- Slower page load times
- Poor Core Web Vitals scores

Solution:
  1. performance-engineer: Continuous monitoring
  2. frontend-engineer: Performance-focused implementation
  3. Automated performance budgets in CI/CD
  4. Regular performance audits
```

## Best Practices Summary
