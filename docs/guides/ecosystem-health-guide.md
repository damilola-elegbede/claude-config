## Overview

The agent ecosystem health monitoring system ensures that all specialized AI agents maintain consistency, compliance, and optimal performance. Regular audits and proactive maintenance prevent degradation and ensure the ecosystem evolves cohesively.

### Key Health Indicators
- **Compliance Score**: Adherence to system boundaries and constraints
- **Documentation Quality**: Completeness and accuracy of agent specifications
- **Capability Coverage**: Breadth and depth of specialized functions
- **Integration Health**: Inter-agent coordination effectiveness
- **Performance Metrics**: Response time, success rates, and resource utilization

## Running Comprehensive Audits

### Using the /agent-audit Command

The `/agent-audit` command provides a complete ecosystem health assessment by running multiple specialized auditors in parallel.

#### Basic Audit Command
```bash
/agent-audit
```

This triggers parallel execution of:
- **agent-auditor** instances for each agent category
- **codebase-analyst** for structural assessment
- **security-auditor** for vulnerability checks
- **performance-analyst** for efficiency metrics

#### Targeted Audits
```bash
# Audit specific agent categories
/agent-audit --category development
/agent-audit --category infrastructure

# Audit specific agents
/agent-audit --agents backend-engineer,frontend-engineer

# Deep compliance check
/agent-audit --deep --compliance-focus
```

### Audit Execution Strategy

The audit runs in parallel phases:

#### Phase 1: Parallel Category Audits
- Documentation agents audit
- Development agents audit
- Infrastructure agents audit
- Analysis agents audit
- Testing agents audit

#### Phase 2: Cross-Cutting Analysis
- Integration pattern validation
- Constraint consistency verification
- Performance benchmarking

#### Phase 3: Synthesis & Reporting
- Aggregate findings
- Calculate health scores
- Generate remediation recommendations

## Common Compliance Issues & Fixes

### Issue 1: Agents Attempting Tool Invocation
**Symptom**: Agents trying to use Read, Write, or other tools directly
**Impact**: -5 to -10 health score points

**Fix**:
```markdown
# In agent specification
## Execution Model
- YOU provide analysis and recommendations
- The orchestrator (Claude) handles ALL tool operations
- NEVER attempt to invoke tools directly
```

### Issue 2: Self-Invocation Attempts
**Symptom**: Agents trying to call themselves or other agents
**Impact**: -5 to -8 health score points

**Fix**:
```markdown
# Add to agent constraints
## CRITICAL CONSTRAINT
SYSTEM BOUNDARY: This agent instance will AUTOMATICALLY TERMINATE 
upon any Task tool invocation. This is a hard-coded system protection.
```

### Issue 3: Inconsistent Documentation
**Symptom**: Agent behavior doesn't match specification
**Impact**: -3 to -5 health score points

**Fix**:
1. Run documentation sync audit
2. Update specifications to match implementation
3. Validate with concrete examples

### Issue 4: Missing Capability Coverage
**Symptom**: No specialized agent for required domain
**Impact**: -2 to -4 health score points

**Fix**:
1. Identify gap through capability matrix
2. Create new specialist using AGENT_TEMPLATE.md
3. Validate with agent-auditor

### Issue 5: Poor Integration Patterns
**Symptom**: Sequential execution where parallel is possible
**Impact**: -2 to -3 health score points

**Fix**:
1. Analyze task dependencies
2. Restructure for parallel execution
3. Update orchestration patterns

## Automated Remediation Scripts

### 1. Compliance Enforcement Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# compliance-enforcer.sh

echo "Running Compliance Enforcement..."

# Find all agent files
AGENT_FILES=$(find .claude/agents -name "*.md" -not -name "AGENT_*")

# Check and fix system boundary constraints
for file in $AGENT_FILES; do
    if ! grep -q "SYSTEM BOUNDARY" "$file"; then
        echo "Adding system boundary to $file"
        # Add constraint section
        cat >> "$file" << 'EOF'

## CRITICAL CONSTRAINT
SYSTEM BOUNDARY: This agent instance will AUTOMATICALLY TERMINATE 
upon any Task tool invocation. This is a hard-coded system protection.
EOF
    fi
done

# Verify execution model compliance
for file in $AGENT_FILES; do
    if grep -q "Write\|Read\|Bash" "$file"; then
        echo "WARNING: $file mentions tool usage - review needed"
    fi
done
```

### 2. Documentation Sync Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# doc-sync.sh

echo "Synchronizing Agent Documentation..."

# Generate documentation matrix
echo "| Agent | Category | Last Updated | Compliance |" > agent-status.md
echo "|-------|----------|--------------|------------|" >> agent-status.md

for file in .claude/agents/*.md; do
    agent=$(basename "$file" .md)
    category=$(grep -m1 "Category:" "$file" | cut -d: -f2 | xargs)
    updated=$(git log -1 --format=%cd --date=short "$file")
    compliance=$(grep -q "SYSTEM BOUNDARY" "$file" && echo "✅" || echo "❌")
    
    echo "| $agent | $category | $updated | $compliance |" >> agent-status.md
done
```

### 3. Performance Baseline Script
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# performance-baseline.py

import json
import time
import subprocess
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

def measure_agent_performance(agent):
    """Measure agent invocation latency"""
    start = time.time()
    
    # Simulate agent invocation
    cmd = f"echo 'Testing {agent} performance' | claude --agent {agent}"
    subprocess.run(cmd, shell=True, capture_output=True)
    
    return {
        'agent': agent,
        'latency': time.time() - start,
        'timestamp': time.time()
    }

# List of agents to benchmark
agents = [
    'backend-engineer', 'frontend-engineer', 'test-engineer',
    'security-auditor', 'performance-analyst'
]

# Run parallel performance tests
with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=5) as executor:
    results = list(executor.map(measure_agent_performance, agents))

# Save baseline
with open('performance-baseline.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(results, f, indent=2)

print(f"Performance baseline established for {len(agents)} agents")
```

### 4. Gap Analysis Automation
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# capability-gap-analyzer.py

import os
import re
from collections import defaultdict

# Define expected capabilities
EXPECTED_CAPABILITIES = {
    'development': ['backend', 'frontend', 'mobile', 'database', 'api'],
    'infrastructure': ['cloud', 'devops', 'network', 'kubernetes'],
    'quality': ['test', 'security', 'performance', 'accessibility'],
    'analysis': ['codebase', 'business', 'data'],
    'documentation': ['tech-writer', 'api-documenter']
}

def analyze_gaps():
    """Identify missing capabilities"""
    existing_agents = set()
    gaps = defaultdict(list)
    
    # Scan existing agents
    for file in os.listdir('.claude/agents'):
        if file.endswith('.md') and not file.startswith('AGENT_'):
            agent_name = file.replace('.md', '')
            existing_agents.add(agent_name)
    
    # Check for gaps
    for category, expected in EXPECTED_CAPABILITIES.items():
        for capability in expected:
            found = any(capability in agent for agent in existing_agents)
            if not found:
                gaps[category].append(capability)
    
    return gaps

# Run gap analysis
gaps = analyze_gaps()
if gaps:
    print("Capability Gaps Identified:")
    for category, missing in gaps.items():
        print(f"\n{category}:")
        for capability in missing:
            print(f"  - {capability}")
else:
    print("No capability gaps found!")
```

## Continuous Monitoring Best Practices

  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  health-check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Run Ecosystem Audit
        run: |
          claude /agent-audit > audit-report.md
          
      - name: Check Health Score
        run: |
          score=$(grep "Overall Health Score" audit-report.md | grep -oE '[0-9]+')
          if [ $score -lt 85 ]; then
            echo "Health score below threshold: $score"
            exit 1
          fi
          
      - name: Upload Report
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
