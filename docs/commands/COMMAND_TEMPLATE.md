description: Template for creating new Claude Code commands
argument-hint: [command-name]
---

# Command Template

This template defines the standard format for all Claude Code slash commands.
All commands in `system-configs/.claude/commands/` should follow this structure.

## New Command Template Structure

Use this template to create new commands:

```markdown
---
description: Brief description under 60 chars
argument-hint: [options]
---

# /command-name Command

## Usage

```bash
/command-name              # Basic usage
/command-name --flag       # With options
/command-name argument     # With arguments
```

## Description

Brief explanation of what this command does and when to use it. Keep it concise.

## Expected Output

```text
Example of what successful execution looks like
Including success indicators and common variations
```

## Behavior (optional)

Detailed behavior, workflows, agent strategies if needed for complex commands.
```

## Frontmatter Fields

### Required Fields

- **description**: A concise, clear description of the command's purpose (shown in autocomplete)

### Optional Fields

- **argument-hint**: Shows users what arguments to provide (e.g., `[branch-name]`, `[file-path]`)
- **allowed-tools**: Specify which tools can be used (e.g., `Bash(git add:*)`)
- **model**: Override the default model (e.g., `claude-3-5-haiku-20241022`)

## Best Practices

1. **Description**: Keep it under 60 characters for clean autocomplete display
2. **Argument Hints**: Use square brackets for optional args: `[file-path]`
3. **Usage Section**: Show common invocation patterns with clear examples
4. **Expected Output**: Include concrete examples of successful execution
5. **Behavior Section**: Only include for complex commands requiring detailed workflow explanation
