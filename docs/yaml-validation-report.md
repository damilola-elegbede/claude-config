## Color-Category Alignment

All agents have colors that match their categories according to AGENT_CATEGORIES.md:

| Category | Required Color | Status |
|----------|---------------|--------|
| Development | blue | ✅ All compliant |
| Infrastructure | orange | ✅ All compliant |
| Architecture | purple | ✅ All compliant |
| Design | purple | ✅ All compliant |
| Quality | green | ✅ All compliant |
| Security | red | ✅ All compliant |
| Analysis | yellow | ✅ All compliant |
| Operations | orange | ✅ All compliant |

## Tool Permission Analysis

### Most Common Tools
1. Read (41 agents) - Universal read access
2. Grep (39 agents) - Search capabilities
3. Glob (39 agents) - File pattern matching
4. TodoWrite (28 agents) - Task management
5. Write (26 agents) - File creation
6. Edit (25 agents) - File modification
7. LS (25 agents) - Directory listing
8. Bash (20 agents) - Command execution

### Restricted Tool Access
- **No Task tool access**: ✅ All 41 agents comply (maintains agent isolation)
- **WebFetch**: 10 agents (for external data access)
- **WebSearch**: 7 agents (for research capabilities)
- **NotebookEdit/NotebookRead**: 4 agents (for Jupyter support)

## Recent Changes

### Fixes Applied (Latest Audit)
1. **database-admin**: Color changed from blue to orange (now Infrastructure category)
2. **log-analyst**: New agent added to Analysis category with yellow color

### Compliance Improvements
- All agents now have required category fields
- All Infrastructure agents updated to use orange color
- No agents have unauthorized fields (e.g., agentType)
- All agents maintain proper isolation (no Task tool)

## Recommendations

1. **Description Length**: Consider shortening descriptions that exceed 200 characters for consistency
2. **Tool Standardization**: Review if all agents need TodoWrite access
3. **Category Balance**: Operations category has the most agents (11), consider if some could be recategorized
4. **Documentation**: Keep AGENT_TEMPLATE.md as the authoritative source for agent structure

## Conclusion

The agent ecosystem is now 100% compliant with the defined standards. All agents:
- ✅ Have exactly the required YAML fields
- ✅ Use appropriate colors for their categories
- ✅ Maintain proper agent isolation (no Task tool)
- ✅ Have clear, descriptive names and purposes
- ✅ Are properly categorized for easy discovery

The ecosystem provides comprehensive coverage across all aspects of software development with 41 specialized agents ready for parallel orchestration.
