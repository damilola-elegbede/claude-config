### Command Mapping

| Command | Primary Agent | Secondary Agents | Execution Mode |
|---------|--------------|------------------|----------------|
| `/test` | test-engineer | qa-tester | Single |
| `/review` | code-reviewer | security-auditor, qa-tester | Parallel |
| `/security` | security-auditor | - | Single |
| `/perf` | performance-engineer | - | Single |
| `/docs` | tech-writer | - | Single |
| `/debug` | debugger | - | Single |
| `/orchestrate` | project-orchestrator | - | Planning |
| `/context` | codebase-analyst | codebase-analyst (multiple) | Parallel |

### Agent Selection Algorithm

```python
def select_agents(task):
    # 1. Check for direct command mapping
    if task.starts_with_command():
        return command_to_agent_map[task.command]
    
    # 2. Analyze task complexity
    complexity = analyze_complexity(task)
    
    # 3. Identify required domains
    domains = identify_domains(task)
    
    # 4. Select primary agent
    if complexity == "staff_level":
        primary = select_staff_agent(domains)
    elif complexity == "senior_level":
        primary = "fullstack-lead"
    else:
        primary = select_specialist(domains)
    
    # 5. Identify supporting agents
    supporting = identify_supporting_agents(task, primary)
    
    # 6. Plan execution mode
    if len(supporting) > 2:
        orchestrator = "project-orchestrator"
        return orchestrator.plan(primary, supporting)
    
    return {
        "primary": primary,
        "supporting": supporting,
        "mode": "parallel" if independent(supporting) else "sequential"
    }
```

### Parallel Execution Patterns

#### Independent Development
```yaml
execution:
  mode: parallel
  agents:
    - type: backend-staff
      task: implement_auth_service
    - type: backend-staff  
      task: implement_payment_service
    - type: frontend-staff
      task: implement_ui_components
    - type: mobile-staff
      task: implement_mobile_app
```

#### Quality Gates
```yaml
execution:
  mode: parallel
  phase: pre_deployment
  agents:
    - type: code-reviewer
      task: review_code_quality
    - type: security-auditor
      task: security_assessment  
    - type: qa-tester
      task: test_coverage_check
    - type: performance-engineer
      task: performance_validation
```
