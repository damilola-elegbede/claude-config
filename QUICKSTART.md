# Pre-Commit Strategy Quick Start Guide

## 🚀 Get Started in 2 Minutes

This guide gets you up and running with the complete pre-commit validation system.

### Step 1: Complete Setup
```bash
make setup
```
This installs all dependencies and git hooks across macOS, Linux, and Windows.

### Step 2: Verify Installation
```bash
make doctor
```
Checks your environment and reports any issues.

### Step 3: Test the System
```bash
make validate-all
```
Runs the complete validation suite on your repository.

### Step 4: Try a Commit
```bash
# Make a small test change
echo "# Test" >> test-file.md
git add test-file.md
git commit -m "Test pre-commit validation"
```
This will trigger automatic validation before the commit completes.

## 🔧 Essential Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `make help` | Show all available commands |
| `make status` | Quick repository health check |
| `make validate-all` | Run all validations manually |
| `make fix-all` | Auto-fix common issues |
| `make clean` | Clean temporary files |

## 🆘 Common Issues

**If validation fails:**
```bash
make fix-all      # Auto-fix issues
make validate-all # Verify fixes
```

**If hooks aren't working:**
```bash
make install-hooks
```

**If environment has issues:**
```bash
make setup
make doctor
```

**Emergency bypass (use sparingly):**
```bash
git commit --no-verify -m "Emergency commit"
```
