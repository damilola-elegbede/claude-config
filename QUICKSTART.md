- **ml-engineer** - Machine learning and AI systems

### Quality Team (4 agents)

- **test-engineer** - Testing strategies and automation
- **code-reviewer** - Code quality and best practices
- **security-auditor** - Security validation and compliance
- **performance-specialist** - Performance optimization
- **accessibility-auditor** - WCAG compliance validation

### Architecture Team (5 agents)

- **principal-architect** - System design and technical leadership
- **api-architect** - API design and integration patterns
- **cloud-architect** - Cloud infrastructure design

[See complete agent list in the documentation](docs/agents/AGENT_CATEGORIES.md)

## üîÑ Agent Coordination Examples

### Example 1: Full-Stack Feature Development

```bash
# Deploy coordinated team for new feature
Task: "Build user authentication system with React frontend and Node.js backend"

# Wave 1: Architecture (Parallel - 15 minutes)
- principal-architect: System design
- security-auditor: Security requirements
- api-architect: API specification

# Wave 2: Implementation (Parallel - 30 minutes)
- backend-engineer: API development
- frontend-engineer: UI implementation
- database-admin: Schema design

# Wave 3: Quality (Parallel - 15 minutes)
- test-engineer: Comprehensive testing
- security-auditor: Security validation
- performance-specialist: Optimization

Total Time: ~1 hour (vs 4-6 hours traditional)
```

### Example 2: Mobile App Development

```bash
# Cross-platform mobile development
Task: "Create React Native app with offline capabilities"

# Coordinated team deployment:
- mobile-engineer: React Native implementation
- ui-designer: Mobile design system
- backend-engineer: Mobile-optimized API
- test-engineer: Mobile testing strategy

Performance: 3-4x faster development
```

## üìä Performance Improvements You'll See

### Immediate Gains

| Task | Traditional Time | Framework Time | Improvement |
|------|------------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Repository Analysis** | 1-2 hours | 15-20 minutes | **4-6x faster** |
| **Code Review** | 30-45 minutes | 5-10 minutes | **3-6x faster** |
| **Testing Suite** | 1-2 hours | 15-30 minutes | **4-5x faster** |
| **Documentation** | 2-3 hours | 30-45 minutes | **3-4x faster** |
| **Bug Investigation** | 1-3 hours | 20-30 minutes | **3-6x faster** |

### Quality Improvements

- **Code Quality**: 40-60% fewer issues through specialist review
- **Security**: 100% security validation through security-auditor
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance through accessibility-auditor
- **Performance**: Optimized implementations through performance-specialist
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive docs through tech-writer collaboration

## üõ°Ô∏è Built-in Quality Gates

The framework includes automatic quality enforcement:

### Pre-commit Quality Gates

- ‚úÖ Markdown linting and formatting
- ‚úÖ Code quality checks with ESLint/Prettier
- ‚úÖ Security vulnerability scanning
- ‚úÖ Basic test execution

### Pre-push Quality Gates

- ‚úÖ Full test suite execution
- ‚úÖ YAML validation for agent configurations
- ‚úÖ Performance regression testing
- ‚úÖ Documentation consistency checks

**Important**: NEVER use `--no-verify` to bypass quality gates. If hooks fail, use the framework to fix issues:

```bash
# Fix quality issues automatically
/fix-ci

# Review and resolve issues
/review

# Validate fixes
/test
```

## ‚ö° Power User Tips

### Maximize Parallel Execution

```bash
# Deploy multiple agents simultaneously for complex tasks
Task: "Build e-commerce platform with admin dashboard"

# This deploys 8-12 agents in parallel for 5-6x performance improvement
```

### Use Wave-Based Coordination

```bash
# Organize work in dependency-based waves:
# Wave 1: Architecture and design (parallel)
# Wave 2: Implementation (parallel, based on Wave 1)
# Wave 3: Testing and optimization (parallel, based on Wave 2)
```

### Quality-First Development

```bash
# Embed quality agents in every wave, not just final validation
# Results in 60-80% fewer production issues
```
