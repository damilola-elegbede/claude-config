    def generate_technical_questions(self, job_description):
        """Generate likely technical questions from JD"""

        # Extract technical requirements
        skills = extract_technical_skills(job_description)
        responsibilities = extract_responsibilities(job_description)

        questions = []

        # For each skill, generate questions
        for skill in skills:
            questions.extend(self._generate_skill_questions(skill))

        # For each responsibility, generate scenario questions
        for responsibility in responsibilities:
            questions.extend(self._generate_scenario_questions(responsibility))

        return questions

    def _generate_skill_questions(self, skill):
        """Generate questions for specific skill"""

        templates = {
            'distributed_systems': [
                "How would you design a distributed system for [use case]?",
                "Explain how you'd handle consensus in a distributed environment.",
                "Describe a time you debugged a distributed system issue."
            ],
            'kubernetes': [
                "What's your experience with Kubernetes at scale?",

            'leadership': [
                "How do you handle underperforming team members?",
                "Describe your approach to 1-on-1s.",
                "Tell me about a time you had to deliver difficult feedback."
            ]
        }

        skill_lower = skill.lower().replace(' ', '_')
        return templates.get(skill_lower, [
            f"Describe your experience with {skill}.",
            f"How have you used {skill} in production?",
            f"What challenges have you faced with {skill}?"
        ])
```

### Behavioral Questions

        "Tell me about a time you led a team through a difficult challenge.",
        "Describe a situation where you had to influence without authority.",
        "How do you handle conflict within your team?",
        "Tell me about a time you had to make an unpopular decision.",
        "Describe your approach to mentoring and developing team members."

```

## STAR Method Answer Preparation

### STAR Framework

```text
S - Situation: Set the context
T - Task: Describe your responsibility
A - Action: Explain what you did (specifics!)
R - Result: Share quantifiable outcomes
```

### Answer Template Generator

```python
def generate_star_answer(question, anecdote):
    """Generate STAR-format answer from anecdote"""

    template = f"""
Question: {question}

STAR Answer:

Situation:
{anecdote['situation']}

Task:
{anecdote['task']}

Action:
{anecdote['action']}

Result:
{anecdote['result']}

Key Points to Emphasize:
- {anecdote['key_point_1']}
- {anecdote['key_point_2']}
- {anecdote['key_point_3']}

Time: {anecdote['duration']} (Keep answer 2-3 minutes)
"""

    return template
```

### Example STAR Answer

```markdown
**Question:** Tell me about a time you led a team through a difficult technical challenge.

**STAR Answer:**

**Situation:**
At TechCorp, our monolithic application was reaching scalability limits at 10M users, with deployments taking 2+ hours and frequent production incidents affecting customer trust.

**Task:**
As Senior Engineering Manager, I was tasked with migrating to microservices while maintaining zero downtime and keeping feature development on track—a 12-month initiative affecting 25 engineers.

**Action:**
First, I created a phased migration plan prioritizing high-value, low-risk services. I built a platform team of 5 engineers to create shared infrastructure—service mesh, observability, CI/CD. We implemented the strangler pattern, running services in parallel with gradual traffic migration. I established architecture review boards, trained the team through workshops, and created comprehensive runbooks.

**Result:**
We successfully migrated 30+ services over 10 months with zero downtime. Deployment time decreased from 2 hours to 15 minutes (88% improvement), system uptime improved from 99.5% to 99.95%, and we scaled to 25M users while reducing cloud costs by $2M annually. Three engineers I mentored were promoted during this process.

**Key Takeaway:**
Technical transformations succeed when you balance technical excellence with people development. The combination of solid architecture, incremental migration, and team empowerment was critical.
