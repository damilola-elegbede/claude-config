## Hashtag Strategy

### Instagram Hashtag Framework

**Mix of 3 categories:**

- **Niche (2-3):** Specific to your industry (10K-100K posts)
- **Community (1-2):** Your target audience (100K-500K posts)
- **Branded (1):** Your unique hashtag

**Example for fitness coach:**

```text
Niche: #HomeWorkoutsForWomen #BusyMomFitness
Community: #FitnessMotivation #HealthyLifestyle
Branded: #YourCoachingName
```

### Twitter Hashtag Rules

- Maximum 2 hashtags per tweet
- Use trending hashtags when relevant
- Create branded hashtag for campaigns
- Capitalize words for readability (#SocialMediaTips not #socialmediatips)

### Research Hashtags

```bash
# Find related hashtags (manual research)
1. Search primary hashtag on platform
2. Check "Top" posts' hashtags
3. Note hashtags with high engagement
4. Track performance over time
```

## Emoji Usage Guide

### Strategic Placement

**Instagram:**

- In caption to break up text ✅
- Bullet points (→ • ▸ ‣)
- Category markers (🎯 📌 💡)

**Twitter:**

- Start of tweet for visibility
- Replace common words (🚀 for "launch")
- Sparingly (1-2 per tweet)

**Facebook:**

- More conservative
- Use for emphasis only
- Reactions > emojis in text

### Common Emoji Meanings

| Emoji | Usage | Context |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 🚀 | Launch, growth, speed | Product launches, achievements |
| 💡 | Idea, tip, insight | Educational content |
| 🎯 | Goal, target, focus | Strategy, planning |
| ⚡ | Fast, energy, power | Quick tips, urgent |
| 🔥 | Hot, trending, exciting | Popular content, deals |
| 👇 | CTA, look below | Directing attention |
| ✨ | New, special, magic | Announcements, features |
| 💪 | Strength, motivation | Inspirational content |

## Accessibility Best Practices

### Alt Text Guidelines

**Instagram:**

```python
alt_text = "Woman in blue workout clothes doing yoga pose on beach at sunset"
# Describe: Who, What, Where, When
# Keep under 100 characters
# Don't start with "Image of..."
```

**Twitter:**

```python
alt_text = "Graph showing 300% increase in engagement after implementing content strategy"
# Focus on data insights for charts
# Describe visual hierarchy
# Max 1000 characters
```

### Caption Considerations

- Include closed captions for video (required)
- Avoid wall of text (use line breaks)
- Don't use excessive emojis (screen readers read each one)
- Spell out acronyms on first use
- Use CamelCase for multi-word hashtags (#SocialMediaTips)

## Cross-Platform Posting Script

```python

        # Add line breaks every 3-4 words for readability
        formatted = self._add_line_breaks(caption)

        # Add hashtags at end
        hashtags = ' '.join([f"#{tag}" for tag in self.content.get('hashtags', [])])

        return {
            'caption': f"{formatted}\n\n{hashtags}",
            'image_specs': {'width': 1080, 'height': 1080},
            'alt_text': self.content.get('alt_text', '')
        }

    def for_twitter(self):
        """Optimize for Twitter"""
        text = self.content['text']

        # Truncate to 280 chars including hashtags and link
        max_length = 280
        link_length = 23  # Twitter's t.co length
        hashtag_length = sum(len(tag) + 2 for tag in self.content.get('hashtags', [])[:2])

        available = max_length - link_length - hashtag_length - 3  # spaces
        truncated = text[:available]

        hashtags = ' '.join([f"#{tag}" for tag in self.content.get('hashtags', [])[:2]])

        return {
            'text': f"{truncated} {hashtags}",
            'image_specs': {'width': 1200, 'height': 675}
        }

    def for_facebook(self):
        """Optimize for Facebook"""
        # Facebook allows long form but engagement drops after 250 chars
        caption = self.content['text']

        if len(caption) > 250:
            # Add "See more" hook in first 250
            hook = caption[:247] + "..."
            full = caption
        else:
            hook = full = caption

        return {
            'text': full,
            'preview': hook,
            'image_specs': {'width': 1200, 'height': 630}
        }

    def _add_line_breaks(self, text, words_per_line=4):
        """Add line breaks for readability"""
        words = text.split()
        lines = []

        for i in range(0, len(words), words_per_line):
            lines.append(' '.join(words[i:i+words_per_line]))

        return '\n'.join(lines)
```
