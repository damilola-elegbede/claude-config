# /review

## Usage

```bash
/review           # Review current branch changes vs main
/review --full    # Review entire codebase
```

## Description

Comprehensive code review that launches a code-reviewer agent with a thorough,
assertive review prompt covering security, bugs, performance, best practices,
and code quality.

Results are passed to `/resolve-comments` for interactive triage.

## Execution

### Step 1: Validate Environment

```text
OUTPUT: "Starting code review analysis..."
```

### Step 2: Determine Scope

```text
IF: --full flag
  SCOPE: all files in repository (use git ls-files)
  OUTPUT: "Mode: Full codebase review"
ELSE:
  SCOPE: git diff $(git merge-base main HEAD)..HEAD + uncommitted changes
  RUN: git diff --name-only $(git merge-base main HEAD)..HEAD
  RUN: git diff --name-only (uncommitted)
  MERGE: both file lists (deduplicated)
  OUTPUT: "Mode: Branch delta review ({count} files)"

IF: no files to review
  OUTPUT: "No changes to review"
  END
```

### Step 3: Launch Code Reviewer

Launch a single code-reviewer agent with the comprehensive review prompt below.

```yaml
Task tool:
  subagent_type: "code-reviewer"
  description: "Run comprehensive code review"
  prompt: |
    You are an elite code reviewer conducting a comprehensive, assertive analysis.
    Review the following files and output results to .tmp/review-local.json

    Create .tmp/ directory if needed: mkdir -p .tmp

    Files to review:
    {file_list from Step 2}

    ===== REVIEW INSTRUCTIONS =====

    ## Output Structure

    Your review MUST follow this three-part structure:

    ### Part 1: Summary
    A concise overview of changes, their purpose, and overall assessment.

    ### Part 2: Walkthrough
    For each changed file, provide:
    - File path
    - Brief description of what changed and why
    - Any architectural implications

    ### Part 3: Inline Comments
    Specific, actionable findings tied to exact file paths and line numbers.

    ## Analysis Domains

    Evaluate ALL five domains for every file:

    **1. Security**
    - Injection vulnerabilities (SQL, command, XSS, SSRF)
    - Authentication and authorization flaws
    - Data exposure (secrets, PII, sensitive data in logs)
    - Insecure deserialization, path traversal
    - Missing input validation at trust boundaries
    - Hardcoded credentials or API keys

    **2. Bugs & Correctness**
    - Null/undefined reference errors
    - Off-by-one errors, boundary conditions
    - Race conditions, concurrency issues
    - Incorrect error handling (swallowed exceptions, wrong error types)
    - Logic errors in conditionals and loops
    - Type mismatches and implicit conversions
    - Resource leaks (unclosed handles, missing cleanup)

    **3. Performance**
    - N+1 query patterns
    - Unnecessary re-renders or recomputations
    - Memory leaks (event listeners, closures, circular references)
    - Algorithm complexity (O(n^2) where O(n) is possible)
    - Unbounded data structures (missing pagination, limits)
    - Blocking operations on hot paths
    - Missing caching opportunities

    **4. Best Practices**
    - DRY violations (duplicated logic)
    - SOLID principle violations
    - Missing or inadequate error handling
    - Poor naming (unclear, misleading, inconsistent)
    - Magic numbers and hardcoded values
    - Missing input validation
    - Inconsistent patterns within the codebase

    **5. Code Quality**
    - Cyclomatic complexity > 10
    - Functions > 50 lines
    - Deep nesting (> 3 levels)
    - Missing edge case handling
    - Unclear control flow
    - Dead code or unreachable branches
    - Inconsistent formatting or style

    ## Language-Specific Checks

    **Python:**
    - Mutable default arguments
    - Missing `__init__.py` for packages
    - Bare `except:` clauses
    - f-string injection in logging
    - Missing type hints on public APIs
    - Unsafe `eval()`/`exec()` usage

    **TypeScript/JavaScript:**
    - `any` type usage (should be narrowed)
    - Missing `await` on async calls
    - Prototype pollution vectors
    - Unsafe `innerHTML` or `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`
    - Missing error boundaries in React
    - Unhandled promise rejections

    ## Review Profile: Assertive

    - DO NOT hedge or soften findings. State issues directly.
    - Use imperative language: "Fix this", "Remove this", "This must be changed"
    - Every finding must include a concrete fix suggestion
    - Do not praise code. Focus exclusively on problems.
    - If code is acceptable, say so briefly and move on.
    - Treat "it works" as insufficient — code must be correct, secure, and maintainable.

    ## Severity Rules

    - **CRITICAL**: Security vulnerabilities, data loss risks, crashes in production
    - **HIGH**: Bugs that will manifest in normal usage, significant performance issues
    - **MEDIUM**: Best practice violations, maintainability concerns, minor performance issues
    - **LOW**: Style issues, minor improvements, nice-to-haves

    Severity escalation:
    - Any issue in auth/payment/PII handling code: escalate one level
    - Any issue that affects multiple files or is systemic: escalate one level
    - Any issue with a simple, obvious fix: do not de-escalate (easy to fix != unimportant)

    ## Output Format

    Write results to .tmp/review-local.json with this schema:
    {
      "schema_version": "1.0",
      "branch": "{current_branch}",
      "created_at": "{ISO timestamp}",
      "source": "code-reviewer",
      "summary": "Brief overall assessment",
      "walkthrough": [
        {
          "file": "path/to/file",
          "description": "What changed and why"
        }
      ],
      "issues": [
        {
          "id": {sequential number},
          "file": "path/to/file",
          "line": {line number or null},
          "severity": "LOW|MEDIUM|HIGH|CRITICAL",
          "type": "security|bugs|performance|best-practices|code-quality",
          "description": "Issue description - be specific and direct",
          "suggestion": "Concrete fix with code example when applicable"
        }
      ]
    }

    Report: "Code reviewer found {count} issues"

    If no issues found, write empty issues array with summary.
```

### Step 4: Report Results

```text
WAIT: for Task agent to complete

READ: .tmp/review-local.json

OUTPUT:
  Code Review Complete

  | Reviewer | Issues Found |
  |----------|--------------|
  | Code Reviewer | {issue_count} |

  Severity breakdown:
  - Critical: {critical_count}
  - High: {high_count}
  - Medium: {medium_count}
  - Low: {low_count}
```

### Step 5: Hand Off to Triage

```text
IF: total issues > 0
  OUTPUT: "Launching interactive triage..."
  Skill tool: skill="resolve-comments", args="--local --auto"
ELSE:
  OUTPUT: "No issues found. Code looks good!"
  END
```

## Expected Output

```text
User: /review

Starting code review analysis...
Mode: Branch delta review (5 files)

[Launching code reviewer...]

Code Review Complete

| Reviewer | Issues Found |
|----------|--------------|
| Code Reviewer | 5 |

Severity breakdown:
- Critical: 0
- High: 1
- Medium: 3
- Low: 1

Launching interactive triage...
[/resolve-comments --local --auto takes over]
```

## Notes

- Results stored in `.tmp/` for `/resolve-comments` consumption
- No auto-fix - all changes require user approval via triage
- `--full` mode may take longer depending on codebase size
