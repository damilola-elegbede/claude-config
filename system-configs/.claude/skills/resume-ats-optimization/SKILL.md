- Keyword density analysis
- Format compatibility checking
- Skills alignment calculation
- Score breakdown and interpretation
- Pass probability estimation

### Resume Optimization

- Keyword extraction and strategic placement
- Resume tailoring for specific roles
- Bullet point optimization for impact
- Action verb selection
- Quantifiable achievement highlighting
- Section ordering and emphasis

## When to Use This Skill

Invoke this skill when:

- Scoring resume against job description
- Tailoring resumes for specific roles
- Improving keyword density and relevance
- Validating ATS compatibility
- Rewriting experience bullets for impact
- Identifying optimization opportunities

## ATS Scoring Algorithm

### Scoring Weights

| Category | Weight | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Keyword Match | 50% | Required and preferred keywords present |
| Skills Alignment | 20% | Technical skills match job requirements |
| Formatting | 20% | ATS-friendly format (no tables, standard fonts) |
| Structure | 10% | Standard sections in logical order |

### Score Interpretation

| Grade | Score | Pass Probability | Action |
|-------|-------|------------------|--------|
| A | 90-100% | 90-95% | Ready to submit |
| B | 80-89% | 70-80% | Minor optimizations |
| C | 70-79% | 50-60% | Optimization needed |
| D | 60-69% | 30-40% | Significant improvements |
| F | <60% | <20% | Major revision needed |

## ATS-Friendly Formatting

### DO

- Use standard section headers (Experience, Education, Skills)
- Use simple fonts (Arial, Calibri, Times New Roman)
- Use standard bullet points (• or -)
- Include keywords naturally from job description
- Use consistent date format (YYYY-MM or Month YYYY)
- Save as .docx or text-based .pdf

### DON'T

- Use tables, text boxes, or columns
- Use headers/footers for critical information
- Use images, logos, or graphics
- Use fancy fonts or heavy styling
- Use unconventional section names

## Bullet Point Optimization

### Formula: Action Verb + Task + Quantifiable Result

**Before (Generic):**

> Managed engineering team and delivered projects

**After (Optimized):**

> Led 15-engineer team through microservices migration, reducing deployment time 88% and achieving 99.95% uptime

### Power Verbs by Category

- **Leadership:** Led, Directed, Managed, Mentored, Spearheaded
- **Achievement:** Delivered, Achieved, Exceeded, Accomplished
- **Technical:** Architected, Designed, Engineered, Implemented
- **Improvement:** Improved, Enhanced, Streamlined, Automated, Reduced

### Quantification Examples

- Team size: "Led team of 25 engineers"
- Performance: "Improved latency by 60%"
- Cost: "Reduced cloud costs by 40% ($2M savings)"
- Scale: "Platform serving 10M+ users"

## Keyword Integration

### Natural Keyword Placement

**Job Requirement:** "Experience with Kubernetes and container orchestration"

**Poor (Keyword Stuffing):**

> Used Kubernetes. Worked with Kubernetes daily.

**Good (Natural):**

> Led migration to Kubernetes-based container orchestration, managing 200+ microservices with 99.95% uptime
