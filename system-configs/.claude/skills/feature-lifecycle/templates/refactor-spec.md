# Refactor: [Title]

## Current State

[Describe the current code structure, architecture, or pattern that needs improvement.]

## Target State

[Describe what the code should look like after refactoring. Be specific about patterns, structure, and organization.]

## Motivation

- [Why this refactor is needed now]
- [What problems the current state causes: maintenance burden, performance, readability]
- [What benefits the target state provides]

## Constraints

- [Behavioral equivalence: no user-facing changes unless specified]
- [Backward compatibility requirements]
- [Migration strategy for dependent code]
- [Testing requirements: coverage must not decrease]

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] [All existing tests continue to pass]
- [ ] [Code follows target state patterns]
- [ ] [No functional regressions]
- [ ] [Performance is equal or better]
- [ ] [Technical debt metric improved: e.g., reduced duplication, simplified dependencies]
