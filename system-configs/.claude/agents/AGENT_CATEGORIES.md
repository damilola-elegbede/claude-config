# Agent Categories and Color Assignments

This document defines the official agent categories and their corresponding color assignments for the Claude Code agent ecosystem. All agents should follow Claude Code documentation standards using "MUST BE USED for" and "Use PROACTIVELY" language patterns.

## Categories

### 1. **Development** (blue)

- Building applications, features, and systems
- Writing production code across languages and frameworks
- Database design and implementation
- API development and integration
- Machine learning model implementation
- Mobile app development
- Data pipeline engineering

### 2. **Infrastructure** (orange)
**Purpose**: Systems, operations, and deployment  
**Color**: `orange`  
**Scope**:
- Cloud infrastructure design and management
- CI/CD pipeline configuration
- Container orchestration and deployment
- Network architecture and configuration
- Platform engineering and tooling
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Monitoring and observability setup

### 3. **Architecture** (purple)
**Purpose**: System design and technical planning  
**Color**: `purple`  
**Scope**:
- High-level system architecture
- API design and governance
- Technology selection and evaluation
- Architectural patterns and best practices
- Technical roadmap planning
- Cross-system integration design
- Scalability and performance architecture

### 4. **Design** (pink)
**Purpose**: User experience and interface design  
**Color**: `pink`  
**Scope**:
- User interface design
- User experience optimization
- Design systems and component libraries
- Mobile UI/UX patterns
- Accessibility design considerations
- Visual design and branding
- Interaction and motion design

### 5. **Quality** (green)
**Purpose**: Testing, review, validation, and verification  
**Color**: `green`  
**Scope**:
- Test strategy and implementation
- Code quality review
- Command execution verification
- Performance testing and optimization
- Security testing and validation
- Accessibility compliance testing
- API contract testing
- Quality metrics and reporting

### 6. **Security** (red)
**Purpose**: Security assessment and compliance  
**Color**: `red`  
**Scope**:
- Security vulnerability assessment
- Penetration testing
- Compliance auditing
- Threat modeling
- Security incident response
- Security architecture review
- Agent ecosystem security validation

### 7. **Analysis** (yellow)
**Purpose**: Research, documentation, and analysis  
**Color**: `yellow`  
**Scope**:
- Business process analysis
- Codebase analysis and technical debt assessment
- Data analysis and insights
- Market and competitive research
- Technical documentation creation
- Requirements analysis
- Performance analysis

### 8. **Operations** (teal)
**Purpose**: Support, coordination, and strategic planning  
**Color**: `teal`  
**Scope**:
- Incident management and response
- Debugging and troubleshooting
- Product strategy and roadmapping
- Project orchestration and coordination
- Operational tooling and automation
- Configuration management
- Workflow automation
- File and dependency management

## Color Assignment Guidelines

When creating new agents, use the color associated with their primary category:

- **blue**: Development work (coding, implementation)
- **orange**: Infrastructure (deployment, monitoring, cloud management)
- **purple**: Architecture (system design, technical planning)
- **pink**: Design (UI/UX, user experience, interface design)
- **green**: Quality assurance (testing, reviews)
- **red**: Security and compliance (auditing, threat analysis)
- **yellow**: Analysis and research (data, documentation, investigation)
- **teal**: Operations (coordination, strategy, workflow automation)

## Usage

1. All agents must be assigned to exactly one category
2. The agent's color field must match their category's color
3. When creating new agents, consult this document for proper categorization
4. The agent-auditor uses these categories for gap analysis
5. All agent descriptions must use "MUST BE USED for" pattern for critical use cases
6. Include "Use PROACTIVELY" for automatic deployment triggers
7. Upgrade agents to Sonnet 4.1 capabilities with enhanced AI reasoning descriptions

## Documentation Standards

### Required Language Patterns
- **Critical Use Cases**: "MUST BE USED for [specific capability]"
- **Proactive Deployment**: "Use PROACTIVELY when [trigger condition]"
- **AI Enhancement**: Describe Sonnet 4.1 advanced reasoning capabilities
- **Specialization**: "Specializes in [key differentiators]"

### Agent Enhancement Guidelines
- Upgrade model specifications to leverage Sonnet 4.1 capabilities
- Include "Advanced AI Capabilities" section highlighting 4.1 features
- Add "Proactive Deployment Triggers" for automatic agent invocation
- Enhance success metrics with AI-powered improvements

## Maintenance

- Regular review of agent capabilities alignment with Claude 4.1 features
- Validation of language pattern compliance across all agents
- Category assignments reviewed quarterly for optimal organization
