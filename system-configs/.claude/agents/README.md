## Decision Framework: Smart Agent Selection

### When to Use Agents vs. Direct Action

| Complexity | Duration | Action | Example |
|------------|----------|--------|---------|
| **Simple** | < 5 min | Handle directly | Fix typos, read files, explain concepts |
| **Moderate** | 5-30 min | Consider specialists | Code review, simple debugging |
| **Complex** | > 30 min | Always use specialists | Feature development, architecture |
| **Critical** | Any time | Always use specialists | Security, data handling, production |

### Scope-Based Decisions

- **Single file** → Usually handle directly
- **2-5 files** → Consider specialists for complex logic
- **5+ files** → Deploy specialists
- **Cross-system** → Always use multiple specialists in parallel

### Non-Negotiable Agent Requirements

✅ **ALWAYS use agents for:**

- Authentication/Authorization code → security-auditor
- Database migrations → database-evolution-specialist + database-admin
- Production incidents → incident-commander
- API design changes → api-architect
- Performance regression → performance-specialist
- 3+ parallel tasks → Deploy in parallel, use project-orchestrator for coordination

### Command Shortcuts

```bash
/test         → test-engineer
/review       → code-reviewer  
/security     → security-auditor
/perf         → performance-specialist
/docs         → tech-writer
/debug        → debugger
/context      → codebase-analyst
/orchestrate  → project-orchestrator
```

### Core Orchestration Rules

1. **Right tool for the job** - Specialists for expertise, direct action for simplicity
2. **Parallel-first execution** - Default to parallel when tasks are independent
3. **Use project-orchestrator for 3+ agent coordination**
4. **Focus on outcomes, optimize for speed and quality**

### Resource Optimization Guidelines

#### Cost vs. Speed Trade-offs

- **High Priority/Urgent**: Use Opus agents (project-orchestrator, principal-architect)
- **Standard Development**: Use Sonnet agents (most specialists)
- **Analysis/Documentation**: Use Haiku agents when available
- **Parallel Execution**: Balance cost with time savings

#### Token Management

- **Large Codebases**: Use codebase-analyst for initial mapping, then targeted specialists
- **Documentation**: Use tech-writer for comprehensive docs, avoid multiple agents on same content
- **Code Reviews**: Use code-reviewer for full review, security-auditor for security-specific concerns

#### Agent Instance Optimization

```yaml
Single Instance: Most development and analysis tasks
Multiple Instances:
  - Multiple microservices (backend-engineer per service)
  - Multi-platform (mobile-platform-engineer per platform)
  - Large-scale analysis (codebase-analyst per domain)
  - Comprehensive audits (security-auditor per security domain)
```

### Failure Recovery Patterns

#### When Agents Fail

```yaml
Scenario: Agent timeout or poor output
Recovery:
  1. Immediate: Claude handles directly with user notification
  2. Short-term: Retry with alternative agent if available
  3. Long-term: Update agent capabilities or create new specialist

Example:
  - security-auditor fails → Claude does basic security check + warns user
  - performance-specialist unavailable → Use monitoring-specialist + manual analysis
```

#### Integration Conflicts (Parallel Agents)

```yaml
File Conflicts:
  Resolution: Serialize file operations, maintain parallel for analysis
  Owner: project-orchestrator coordinates file access

API Contract Conflicts:
  Resolution: api-architect makes final decision
  Process: Agents propose, architect decides, all agents implement

Performance vs Security Trade-offs:
  Resolution: Security requirements take precedence
  Process: security-auditor → performance-specialist (optimization within constraints)

Test Failures from Parallel Changes:
  Resolution: Re-run tests after integration
  Process: test-engineer validates after all parallel changes complete
```

## Execution Best Practices & Anti-Patterns

### Optimal Execution Patterns ✅

#### Smart Agent Selection

- **Right-sized Response**: Handle simple tasks directly, delegate complex work to specialists
- **Parallel-First Thinking**: Default to parallel execution for independent tasks
- **Specialist Expertise**: Use domain experts for their specific capabilities
- **Cost-Conscious Orchestration**: Balance speed, quality, and resource costs

#### Effective Coordination

- **Clear Handoffs**: Provide explicit context, success criteria, and artifacts between agents
- **Quality Integration**: Run quality agents in parallel, establish clear pass/fail criteria
- **Proactive Orchestration**: Use project-orchestrator for 3+ agent coordination
- **Continuous Validation**: Validate agent outputs before proceeding to next phase

#### Resource Optimization

- **Token Management**: Use targeted analysis before broad implementation
- **Model Selection**: Match agent model (Opus/Sonnet/Haiku) to task complexity
- **Parallel Scaling**: Deploy multiple instances of same agent type when beneficial
- **Critical Path Focus**: Identify and optimize bottlenecks in agent workflows

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid ❌

#### Poor Agent Selection

```yaml
WRONG: devops for code review
RIGHT: code-reviewer for code quality assessment

WRONG: Generic search for log analysis
RIGHT: monitoring-specialist for log pattern analysis

WRONG: Manual dependency management
RIGHT: dependency-strategist for dependency analysis

WRONG: Claude doing security audit
RIGHT: security-auditor for security assessment
```

#### Sequential When Parallel is Possible

```yaml
WRONG: backend-engineer → wait → frontend-architect → wait → test-engineer
RIGHT: [backend-engineer + frontend-architect + test-engineer] (parallel)

WRONG: Single codebase-analyst for large system
RIGHT: Multiple codebase-analyst instances (parallel by domain)

WRONG: Sequential quality checks
RIGHT: [code-reviewer + security-auditor + test-engineer] (parallel)
```

#### Poor Orchestration

```yaml
WRONG: Launch 5+ agents without coordination
RIGHT: project-orchestrator → coordinated execution plan

WRONG: Ignore agent failures silently
RIGHT: Validate outputs, retry or handle directly with user notification

WRONG: Conflicting agent outputs without resolution
RIGHT: Clear priority hierarchy and conflict resolution process
```

#### Resource Waste

```yaml
WRONG: Opus agents for simple documentation
RIGHT: Sonnet agents for standard technical writing

WRONG: Multiple agents on same simple task
RIGHT: Single appropriate agent or direct handling

WRONG: Over-analysis before implementation
RIGHT: Just-enough analysis to start implementation
```

## Tool Permissions & Security Model

Agents are granted minimal necessary permissions following the principle of least privilege:

| Permission Level | Example Agents | Allowed Tools | Security Rationale |
|-----------------|----------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Full Access** | backend-engineer, frontend-architect, mobile-platform-engineer | All tools | Core development requires full access |
| **Read & Analysis** | code-reviewer, codebase-analyst, security-auditor | Read, Grep, Glob, LS | Analysis-only, no modification capability |
| **Documentation** | tech-writer | Read, Write, Edit, MultiEdit | Documentation creation and updates |
| **Infrastructure** | devops, cloud-architect, kubernetes-admin | Read, Write, Edit, Bash | Infrastructure management requires system access |
| **Quality Gates** | test-engineer, quality-gatekeeper | Read, Write, Edit, Bash | Testing requires execution capabilities |
| **Strategic Planning** | project-orchestrator, principal-architect | Read, Write, TodoWrite | Planning and coordination tools |
| **Monitoring** | monitoring-specialist, performance-specialist | Read, Grep, Glob, LS, Bash | System monitoring and analysis |

### Security Boundaries

- **SYSTEM BOUNDARY Protection**: Agents cannot invoke the Task tool (reserved for Claude)
- **Domain Isolation**: Agents cannot exceed their designated domain boundaries
- **Audit Trail**: All agent actions are logged and traceable

| **Feature Development** | UI + API + Tests | Design → Implementation → Testing | Hybrid: Parallel implementation after design |
| **Bug Investigation** | Logs + Performance + Code | Analysis → Reproduction → Fix | Sequential with parallel analysis |
| **Security Audit** | Code + Dependencies + Infrastructure | Assessment → Remediation → Validation | Parallel assessment, sequential remediation |
| **Performance Optimization** | Frontend + Backend + Database | Profiling → Optimization → Testing | Parallel profiling, targeted optimization |
| **Code Review** | Security + Quality + Tests | None (all independent) | Fully parallel |
