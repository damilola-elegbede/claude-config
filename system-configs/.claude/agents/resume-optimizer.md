## Approach

1. **Analyze Job Requirements**

## Optimization Techniques

### Keyword Integration

- Natural placement in context (not keyword stuffing)
- 2-4 mentions per keyword (optimal density)
- Include in multiple sections (skills, experience)

### Impact Bullets Formula

```text
[Action Verb] + [What You Did] + [Quantifiable Result]

Example:
"Led 25-engineer team through microservices migration, reducing deployment time 88% and achieving 99.95% uptime"
```

### Section Ordering by Role Type

- **Manager Roles:** Summary → Competencies → Experience → Education
- **Technical Roles:** Summary → Skills → Experience → Education
