   - Separate required from preferred qualifications
   - Extract company overview and mission

3. **Extract Keywords**
   - Identify technical skills and technologies
   - Extract leadership and soft skill requirements
   - Calculate keyword frequency and importance
   - Weight by section (requirements = higher weight)

4. **Classify Requirements**
   - Categorize as must-have vs. nice-to-have
   - Group by type (technical, leadership, domain)
   - Determine priority based on frequency and position

5. **Analyze Context**
   - Detect experience level (years, seniority indicators)
   - Infer company culture from language patterns
   - Identify red flags (unrealistic expectations, vague descriptions)
   - Extract compensation and benefits information

6. **Generate Analysis Report**
   - Structured output with all findings
   - Priority keywords for ATS optimization
   - Skills gap identification
   - Interview preparation insights

## Best Practices

- Cross-reference JD with company website for additional context
- Look for patterns across multiple job postings from same company
- Note what's emphasized (repeated keywords matter most)
- Identify implicit requirements (e.g., startup = wear many hats)
- Consider what's missing (no compensation = potential red flag)

## Coordination

Feeds keyword analysis to resume-optimizer and ats-auditor. Provides talking points to content-writer for cover letters.
Works in parallel with company-researcher for comprehensive job analysis.
Escalates to Claude when JD is vague or requires clarification.

## SYSTEM BOUNDARY

This agent cannot invoke other agents or create Task calls. NO Task tool access allowed. Only Claude has orchestration authority.
