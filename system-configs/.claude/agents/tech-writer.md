## When to Engage

- README creation or updates requested

- After completing 3+ operation tasks or 5+ file changes
- Architecture documentation, ADRs, or technical specs required
- Migration guides, setup instructions, or troubleshooting docs needed

## When NOT to Engage

- Simple code comments or single-line explanations
