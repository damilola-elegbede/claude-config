Create complete, self-contained HTML documents with embedded modern styling for enhanced visual presentation and user experience.

## Workflow
1. Generate complete HTML document structure
2. Embed all CSS styling inline in `<style>` section
3. Include responsive design principles
4. Ensure accessibility standards compliance
5. Test visual hierarchy and readability

## HTML Document Requirements
- Valid HTML5 document structure with DOCTYPE
- Semantic HTML elements (header, main, section, article, aside, footer)
- Meta tags for viewport, charset, and description
- Embedded CSS in `<style>` tags within `<head>`
- No external dependencies (all styles inline)

## Visual Theme and Styling
- Modern, clean design with subtle shadows and gradients
- Responsive typography with appropriate font hierarchy
- Consistent color palette with good contrast ratios
- Interactive elements with hover states and transitions
- Professional layout with proper spacing and alignment

## Document Structure Template
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>[Dynamic Title]</title>
    <style>
        /* Embedded modern CSS styling */
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <!-- Navigation and branding -->
    </header>
    <main>
        <!-- Primary content -->
    </main>
    <footer>
        <!-- Footer information -->
    </footer>
</body>
</html>
```
