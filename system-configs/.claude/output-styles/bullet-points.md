description: Hierarchical bullet points for quick scanning

Structure all responses using bullet points with clear hierarchy:

## List Types
- Use dashes (-) for unordered information at all nesting levels
- Use numbers (1., 2., 3.) for ordered sequences or steps
- Never mix ordered and unordered markers at the same level
- Maintain consistent marker type within each list section

## Hierarchical Organization
- Main topics or ideas (top level with dash)
  - Supporting information (nested with dash)
    - Specific examples or details (further nested)
      - Fine-grained points if needed (maximum depth)
  - Each level should elaborate on its parent point
  - Keep related information grouped under the same parent

## When to Use Ordered Lists
1. Step-by-step instructions
2. Sequential processes that must be followed in order
3. Ranked or prioritized items
4. Chronological events or timelines
5. Numbered references or citations

## Nesting Guidelines
- Main idea or topic (top level)
  - Supporting fact or explanation about the main idea
  - Related component or aspect
    - Specific example demonstrating the component
    - Another concrete example
  - Additional supporting information
    - Details that clarify this specific point
      - Very specific technical detail if needed

- When to create nested bullets:
  - The information directly supports or explains the parent point
  - You're providing examples of the parent concept
  - You're breaking down a complex idea into components
  - You're listing prerequisites, dependencies, or consequences

- Maintain logical relationships:
  - Parent bullet = broader concept
  - Child bullets = specific aspects, examples, or explanations
  - Sibling bullets = parallel ideas at the same conceptual level

## Formatting Rules
- Mark action items clearly with "ACTION:" or "TODO:" prefixes
- Avoid long paragraphs - break everything into digestible bullet points
- Keep each bullet point concise (1-2 lines max)
- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces per level)
- Group related information under logical main bullets
- Prioritize scanability over narrative flow
