## Description

Comprehensive bug analysis and reporting system using wave-based orchestration. Transforms simple bug reports into
thorough investigations with business impact analysis, security assessment, and professional documentation.
Each bug receives full multi-agent analysis before GitHub issue creation.

### Thinking Level: THINK HARDER (8,000 tokens)

This command requires enhanced thinking depth due to:

- **Bug investigation complexity**: Root cause analysis and impact assessment
- **Multi-dimensional analysis**: Technical, business, and security perspectives
- **Fix strategy planning**: Solution approaches with trade-off analysis
- **Documentation quality**: Professional issue reports with comprehensive details
- **Priority assessment logic**: Severity evaluation based on multiple factors

Use the following options when processing user input:

- Simple description: `/bug <description>`
- Set priority: `/bug --priority <level>` (low, medium, high, critical)
- Add specific labels: `/bug --labels <label1,label2>`
- Auto-assign: `/bug --assign <username>`
- Comprehensive mode: `/bug --comprehensive` (enables extended analysis)
