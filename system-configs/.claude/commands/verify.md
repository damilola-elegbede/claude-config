# /verify Command

## Usage

```bash
/verify                       # Verify last command
/verify --command "/test"     # Verify specific command
/verify --report-only         # Report without recommendations
```

## Description

Evaluates how well a previous command execution met its requirements. Produces an alignment score with actionable recommendations.

## Behavior

1. **Extract**: Identify requirements from the original command
2. **Analyze**: Compare execution against requirements
3. **Score**: Calculate alignment percentage
4. **Recommend**: Suggest improvements if needed

## Expected Output

```text
User: /verify

📋 Verifying: /test --create

Analyzing execution...

📊 Verification Results:

Overall Alignment: 85%

Category Breakdown:
  ✅ Requirement Completeness: 88%
     - 6/7 explicit requirements met
     - Missing: error boundary handling

  ✅ Implementation Quality: 92%
     - Code follows best practices
     - Proper error handling

  ⚠️ Output Accuracy: 75%
     - Format deviation: JSON instead of YAML
     - Missing summary statistics

🎯 Key Findings:
  1. ❌ Missing error boundary for async operations
  2. ⚠️ Output format should be YAML

💡 Recommendations:
  1. HIGH: Add error boundary handling
  2. MEDIUM: Convert output to YAML format

📈 With fixes applied: projected 94%
