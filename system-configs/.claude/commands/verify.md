# /verify Command

## Usage

```bash
/verify                         # Verify last command execution
/verify --last                  # Explicit last command verification
/verify --command "/test"       # Verify specific command execution
/verify --depth comprehensive   # Maximum analysis depth (basic/standard/comprehensive)
/verify --report-only          # Generate report without recommendations
```

## Description

Comprehensive command execution verification system that evaluates how well
previous instructions were met. Uses multi-wave agent orchestration to analyze
requirement alignment, implementation quality, and output accuracy, producing
both categorical and overall percentage scores with actionable recommendations.

### Thinking Level: THINK HARDER (8,000 tokens)

This command requires enhanced thinking depth due to:

- **Multi-dimensional analysis**: Evaluating execution across multiple quality
  vectors
- **Requirement extraction complexity**: Parsing implicit and explicit
  requirements from context
- **Scoring algorithm precision**: Weighted calculation across diverse metrics
- **Gap identification logic**: Detecting subtle deviations and missing elements
- **Recommendation generation**: Providing actionable, prioritized improvement
  suggestions
