# /pr Command

## Usage

```bash
/pr                     # Creates PR with wave-based analysis to main branch
/pr develop             # Creates PR targeting develop branch
/pr --draft             # Creates draft PR for work in progress
/pr --template          # Uses comprehensive template format
/pr main --draft        # Combined: targets main branch as draft
```

## Description

Creates pull requests using progressive wave-based orchestration for comprehensive analysis and content generation.
Each wave builds upon previous insights to create highly contextual and thorough pull requests.

## Expected Output

When you invoke `/pr $ARGUMENTS`, I will execute three progressive waves of analysis:

### Wave 1: Change Analysis & Understanding

Deploy parallel agents to deeply understand the changes and their scope.

### Wave 2: PR Content Generation

Synthesize wave 1 insights to generate comprehensive PR content across all aspects.

### Wave 3: PR Creation & Enhancement

Create the pull request with metadata, labels, and appropriate reviewer assignments.

**Final Results**: Return PR URL with execution verification showing comprehensive wave-based analysis completion.

## Wave-Based Orchestration Architecture

### Wave 1: Change Analysis & Impact Assessment

**Objective**: Deep understanding of changes, scope, and codebase impact

```yaml
Wave_1_Parallel_Deployment:
  code-reviewer_instances:
    deployment: 3-4 instances based on change complexity
    distribution:
      - instance_1: Frontend/UI change analysis
      - instance_2: Backend/API change analysis
      - instance_3: Infrastructure/config change analysis
      - instance_4: Database/schema change analysis (if applicable)
    input: Git diff, changed files, commit messages
    output: Technical change categorization, complexity assessment

  codebase-analyst:
    role: Overall codebase impact assessment
    input: Changed files, dependency graph, system architecture
    output: Impact radius analysis, affected systems, integration points
    parallel_with: [all code-reviewer instances]

  test-engineer:
    role: Test coverage and quality impact analysis
    input: Test files, coverage reports, changed test patterns
    output: Test coverage gaps, quality gate implications, test strategy needs
    parallel_with: [code-reviewer instances, codebase-analyst]

Claude_Wave_1_Synthesis:
  - Consolidate technical analysis from all code-reviewer instances
  - Integrate codebase impact assessment
  - Understand test coverage implications
  - Determine overall change scope and complexity
  - Prepare context for Wave 2 content generation
```

### Wave 2: PR Content Generation

**Objective**: Generate comprehensive PR description, metadata, and supporting content

```yaml
Wave_2_Parallel_Deployment:
  tech-writer_instances:
    deployment: 3 instances for different content aspects
    distribution:
      - instance_1: PR title and executive summary generation
      - instance_2: Detailed technical change documentation
      - instance_3: Impact summary and deployment notes
    input: Wave 1 consolidated analysis, change scope, technical details
    output: Structured PR content across multiple dimensions
    context: Full understanding from Wave 1 synthesis

  security-auditor:
    role: Security impact analysis and recommendations
    input: Code changes, dependency updates, API modifications, Wave 1 insights
    output: Security assessment, vulnerability analysis, compliance impact
    parallel_with: [tech-writer instances]

  performance-engineer:
    role: Performance implications and optimization opportunities
    input: Algorithm changes, database queries, resource usage patterns
    output: Performance impact assessment, bottleneck analysis, optimization suggestions
    parallel_with: [tech-writer instances, security-auditor]

  business-analyst:
    role: Business value articulation and stakeholder communication
    input: Feature changes, user impact, business requirements
    output: Business value summary, stakeholder impact, user experience changes
    parallel_with: [tech-writer instances, security-auditor, performance-engineer]

Claude_Wave_2_Review:
  - Synthesize all tech-writer content into cohesive PR description
  - Integrate security, performance, and business insights
  - Ensure comprehensive coverage of all change aspects
  - Validate content quality and completeness
  - Prepare final PR content and metadata
```

### Wave 3: PR Creation & Enhancement

**Objective**: Create pull request with rich metadata and appropriate workflow integration

```yaml
Wave_3_Sequential_Execution:
  pr-creation:
    action: Create pull request via GitHub API
    content: Wave 2 synthesized PR description and metadata
    configuration: Target branch, draft status, template usage

  metadata-enhancement:
    labels: Auto-generated based on change analysis (frontend, backend, security, performance)
    reviewers: Assigned based on code ownership and change impact
    projects: Link to relevant project boards based on business impact
    milestones: Associate with appropriate release milestone

  issue-linking:
    related-issues: Auto-detect and link related issues from commit messages
    closes-issues: Identify and link issues resolved by changes
    references: Add contextual references to related PRs and discussions

Claude_Final_Verification:
  - Confirm PR creation success
  - Verify all metadata applied correctly
  - Validate reviewer assignments
  - Provide comprehensive PR URL and summary
```

# Comprehensive template format with wave insights
```

## Behavior Rules

When you invoke `/pr`, execute this wave-based orchestration:

### Wave 1 Execution Pattern

1. **Deploy Change Analysis Wave**: Launch code-reviewer instances (3-4), codebase-analyst, and test-engineer in parallel
2. **Synthesize Understanding**: Consolidate all Wave 1 outputs into comprehensive change context
3. **Prepare Wave 2 Context**: Create rich input context for content generation agents

### Wave 2 Execution Pattern

1. **Deploy Content Generation Wave**: Launch tech-writer instances (3), security-auditor, performance-engineer, and business-analyst in parallel
2. **Review and Integrate**: Synthesize all content outputs into cohesive PR description
3. **Prepare PR Metadata**: Generate labels, reviewer suggestions, and linking context

### Wave 3 Execution Pattern

1. **Create Pull Request**: Submit via GitHub API with wave-generated content
2. **Enhance with Metadata**: Apply labels, assign reviewers, link issues
3. **Verify and Report**: Confirm success and provide comprehensive results

### Quality Assurance

- Always validate branch status before Wave 1
- Ensure comprehensive test coverage analysis in Wave 1
- Cross-validate security and performance implications in Wave 2
- Verify all PR metadata application in Wave 3

## Arguments

- `target_branch` (optional): Target branch for PR (default: main/master)
- `--draft`: Create as draft PR
- `--template`: Use comprehensive PR template with full wave insights
