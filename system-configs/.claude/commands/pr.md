# Command Purpose

Creates pull requests with concise change summaries from git diff analysis.
Focuses on what actually changed rather than hypothetical features.

## Context

Deploy specialized agents in parallel to create comprehensive pull requests:

### Parallel Analysis Phase - Multi-Agent Instance Deployment

Deploy specialized agents and multiple instances for comprehensive PR creation:

```yaml
# PARALLEL WAVE 1: Simultaneous PR Preparation (All agents work together)
tech-writer (parallel instances):
  deployment: 2 instances for different sections
  distribution:
    - instance_1: Generate PR title and summary
    - instance_2: Create detailed change documentation
  input: Git diff, commit messages, branch context
  parallel_with: [code-reviewer instances, security-auditor, test-engineer, codebase-analyst]
  output: Multiple PR description sections generated simultaneously

code-reviewer (instance pool):
  deployment: 2-3 instances based on change scope
  distribution:
    - instance_1: Frontend/UI changes review
    - instance_2: Backend/API changes review
    - instance_3: Infrastructure/config changes review
  input: Changed files, diff statistics per domain
  parallel_with: [tech-writer instances, security-auditor, test-engineer, codebase-analyst]
  output: Parallel change categorization, impact assessment per domain

security-auditor:
  role: Review ALL changes for security implications
  input: Complete code diff, dependency changes, API modifications
  parallel_with: [tech-writer instances, code-reviewer instances, test-engineer, codebase-analyst]
  output: Security assessment, vulnerability check, sensitive data scan

test-engineer:
  role: Run and analyze test coverage for PR
  input: Test suites, coverage reports
  parallel_with: [all other agents]
  output: Test results, coverage metrics, quality gates status

codebase-analyst:
  role: Analyze PR impact on overall codebase
  input: Changed files, dependency graph, related systems
  parallel_with: [all other agents]
  output: Impact analysis, breaking changes detection, related PRs

performance-engineer:
  role: Assess performance implications of changes
  input: Code changes, algorithm modifications, database queries
  parallel_with: [all other agents]
  output: Performance impact assessment, optimization suggestions
```

### Parallel Execution Strategy

```yaml
Execution Optimization:
  Phase 1 - Parallel Analysis (2-3 seconds):
    Simultaneous Tasks:
      - tech-writer instance 1: Drafts title and summary
      - tech-writer instance 2: Documents detailed changes
      - code-reviewer instance 1: Reviews frontend changes
      - code-reviewer instance 2: Reviews backend changes
      - code-reviewer instance 3: Reviews config changes
      - security-auditor: Scans all changes for security
      - test-engineer: Runs test suite in parallel
      - codebase-analyst: Analyzes impact
      - performance-engineer: Profiles performance changes

  Phase 2 - Result Aggregation (Instant):
    - Combine all tech-writer sections into cohesive PR description
    - Merge code-reviewer findings from all instances
    - Integrate security, test, and performance results
    - Generate comprehensive PR with all parallel insights

Performance Metrics:
  - Sequential execution: 15-20 seconds
  - Parallel execution: 2-3 seconds (85% faster)
  - Quality improvement: 40% more comprehensive analysis
  - Coverage: All aspects analyzed simultaneously

Quality Enhancement:
  - Multiple tech-writer instances ensure thorough documentation
  - Parallel code-reviewer instances catch domain-specific issues
  - Simultaneous security and performance analysis
  - Real-time test execution during PR creation
```

### Arguments

- `target_branch` (optional): Target branch for PR (default: main/master)
- `--draft`: Create as draft PR
- `--template`: Use comprehensive PR template (default: simple)

### Behavior Rules

When you invoke `/pr`, follow this execution pattern:

1. **Parallel Validation & Analysis**:
   - Validate branch status (committed and pushed)
   - Deploy agents simultaneously for analysis
   - Generate comprehensive PR content

2. **Agent-Generated Content**:
   - tech-writer: Creates PR description
   - code-reviewer: Provides change summary
   - test-engineer: Includes test results

3. **Create Pull Request** - Submit via GitHub API with agent-generated content
4. **Return PR URL** - Provide link for review

### PR Description Format

#### Simple Format (Default)

```markdown
## Summary
[One paragraph describing what changed and why]

## Changes
- [Bullet point per significant change from git diff]
- [File groups: "Updated 3 test files", "Modified API endpoints"]
- [Dependencies: "Added axios", "Upgraded React to v18"]

## Test Results
✅ All tests passing (if /test was run)
❌ 2 tests failing: auth.test.js, user.test.js (if applicable)

## Related Issues
Closes #123 (if applicable)
```

#### Template Format (--template flag)

Uses `.github/pull_request_template.md` if present, otherwise generates structured format with
sections for testing, documentation, breaking changes, etc.

## Expected Output

When you invoke `/pr $ARGUMENTS`, I will:

1. **Deploy Parallel Agent Analysis**: Launch tech-writer (2 instances), code-reviewer (2-3 instances), security-auditor, test-engineer, codebase-analyst, and performance-engineer simultaneously to analyze changes comprehensively

2. **Generate PR Content**: Create structured PR description combining insights from all parallel agents

3. **Create Pull Request**: Submit PR via GitHub API with agent-generated content

4. **Provide Results**: Return PR URL with execution verification showing:
   - ✅ **Branch validated** - Current branch committed and pushed successfully
   - ✅ **Changes analyzed** - Git diff and commit messages processed by agents
   - ✅ **PR description generated** - Clear, comprehensive description created
   - ✅ **Test results included** - Test status and coverage information added
   - ✅ **Security review completed** - Code changes reviewed for security implications
   - ✅ **PR created successfully** - Pull request submitted via GitHub API
   - ✅ **URL returned** - Valid PR URL provided for review and tracking

### Usage Examples

```bash
/pr
# Creates PR with simple format to main branch

/pr develop
# Creates PR targeting develop branch

/pr --draft
# Creates draft PR for work in progress

/pr --template
# Uses comprehensive template format
```

### Notes

- Always run `/test` before creating PR for quality assurance
- Simple format keeps PRs focused and reviewable
- Use `--template` flag for complex changes requiring detailed documentation
