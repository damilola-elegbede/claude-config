# /fix-ci Command

## Usage

```bash
/fix-ci                  # Fix latest failure
/fix-ci 12345678         # Fix specific run
/fix-ci --learn          # Update fix patterns from history
```

## Description

Diagnose and fix GitHub Actions failures using pattern recognition and historical fix data. Only pushes when 95%
confident all CI issues are resolved. Tests locally before pushing fixes.

**Important**: Complex CI issues often cascade, requiring multiple remediation waves. The process continues iteratively
until all CI checks pass, with each wave addressing newly discovered failures.

### Thinking Level: MEGATHINK (10,000 tokens)

This command requires substantial thinking depth due to:

- **Complex CI/CD debugging**: Analyzing multiple failure modes across parallel workflows
- **Pattern recognition complexity**: Matching failures against historical fix database
- **Cascading failure analysis**: Understanding interdependent test and build failures
- **Pipeline repair orchestration**: Coordinating fixes across multiple configuration files
- **Confidence calculation logic**: Statistical analysis of fix likelihood and risk assessment

## Expected Output

### Successful CI Fix with Confidence

```text
üîç Pattern confidence: 96%
üîß Applying fix (96% confidence)...
üß™ Testing fix locally...
‚úÖ Local tests passed
üíæ Committed and pushed fix
üìä Recorded outcome: CI passed = true
```

### Multi-Wave Remediation Example

```text
üîç Wave 1: Pattern confidence: 96%
üîß Wave 1: Applying lint fixes (96% confidence)...
üìä Wave 1: CI verification reveals additional test failures
üîß Wave 2: Deploying test fix agents...
üìä Wave 2: CI verification reveals dependency conflicts
üîß Wave 3: Resolving dependency version conflicts...
üìä Wave 3: CI verification reveals environment issues
üîß Wave 4: Fixing environment configuration...

```

### Low Confidence Scenario

```text
User: /fix-ci
Claude: üîç Pattern confidence: 70%
‚ö†Ô∏è Confidence too low (70% < 95%)
üí° Manual review recommended
```

### Learning Mode

```text
User: /fix-ci --learn
Claude: üìä Historical Fix Analysis:
Lint/Format: 98% success rate (47/48 attempts)
Dependencies: 92% success rate (23/25 attempts)
Test Failures: 85% success rate (17/20 attempts)
Type Errors: 78% success rate (14/18 attempts)
```

## Behavior

### Agent Orchestration - Enhanced Multi-Wave Parallel Deployment

#### WAVE 1: Enhanced Parallel Failure Analysis (10-15 agents deployed simultaneously)

```yaml
# ENHANCED PARALLEL WAVE 1: Maximum Simultaneous Analysis
devops (expanded instance pool):
  deployment: 3-4 instances (was 2-3) - based on pipeline complexity
  distribution:
    - instance_1: Pipeline/workflow configuration issues

  deployment: 1-2 instances - security-focused analysis
  distribution:
    - instance_1: Security policy violations and compliance
    - instance_2: Vulnerability scanning and dependency security
  parallel_with: [all other Wave 1 agents]
  output: Security violations, compliance issues

execution-evaluator:
  deployment: 1 instance - coordination and confidence aggregation
  role: Synthesize findings from all Wave 1 agents
  parallel_with: [all other Wave 1 agents]
  output: Consolidated analysis, confidence scoring recommendations
```

#### WAVE 2: Conditional Fix Application (Only if 95%+ confident)

```yaml
# Enhanced Claude Confidence Calculation with Pattern Learning
confidence_calculation:
  base_patterns: Historical success rates from .tmp/fix-ci/
  failure_complexity: Number of different failure types detected
  agent_consensus: Agreement level between Wave 1 agent findings
  historical_similarity: Match strength to previous successful fixes
  environmental_factors: CI vs local environment differences

# Deploy fix agents only when confident
fix_deployment (conditional):
  trigger: confidence >= 95%
  strategy: Multiple parallel fix agents by failure type

  lint_fixes:
    - code-reviewer instance 1: ESLint rule violations
    - code-reviewer instance 2: Prettier formatting issues
    - code-reviewer instance 3: Custom linting rule failures

  test_fixes:
    - test-engineer instance 1: Unit test assertion fixes
    - test-engineer instance 2: Mock and stub corrections
    - test-engineer instance 3: Test environment setup issues

  build_fixes:
    - platform-engineer instance 1: Dependency version resolution
    - platform-engineer instance 2: Build configuration updates
    - devops instance 1: CI pipeline configuration fixes

  deployment_fixes:
    - devops instance 2: Container and orchestration fixes
    - platform-engineer instance 3: Environment variable corrections
    - security-auditor: Security configuration adjustments

local_validation:
  parallel_testing: Run all test suites simultaneously
  lint_validation: Multiple linting tools in parallel
  build_verification: Parallel build across different configurations
  security_scanning: Parallel security checks
```

#### WAVE 3: Enhanced Verification & Monitoring

```yaml
# Verification and continuous monitoring agents
monitoring_deployment:
  ci_monitor:
    deployment: 1 instance
    role: Real-time CI pipeline status monitoring
    duration: Until all checks pass or timeout

  performance_monitor:
    deployment: 1 instance
    role: Track build performance improvements/degradations
    metrics: Build time, test execution speed, resource usage

  pattern_learner:
    deployment: 1 instance
    role: Update pattern database with outcomes
    learning: Record success/failure patterns for future confidence scoring

  regression_detector:
    deployment: 1 instance
    role: Monitor for new issues introduced by fixes
    alert: Flag any new test failures or build issues

success_verification:
  criteria:
    - All CI checks pass (100% success requirement)
    - No new failures introduced
    - Performance metrics maintained or improved
    - Security scans pass
  recording: Update .tmp/fix-ci/history.log with comprehensive outcome data
```

#### WAVE N: Iterative Remediation Cycles

**Critical**: Wave 3 verification may reveal additional failures requiring Wave 4 fixes. Complex CI issues often
cascade, with each remediation wave uncovering new problems that must be addressed.

```yaml
# Iterative remediation pattern for cascading failures
wave_continuation:
  trigger: "CI verification reveals new failures after previous wave fixes"
  process: "Each wave addresses failures discovered in CI runs from previous wave"
  examples:
    - "Wave 4: Address integration test failures revealed after Wave 3 lint fixes"
    - "Wave 5: Resolve environment conflicts exposed by Wave 4 dependency updates"
    - "Wave 6: Fix security violations uncovered by Wave 5 configuration changes"

  escalation_pattern:
    wave_4_plus:
      diagnostic_agents: "Deploy additional specialized agents for complex cascading issues"
      confidence_adjustment: "Lower confidence threshold to 90% for iterative fixes"
      monitoring_intensity: "Increase monitoring frequency and failure detection granularity"

  termination_conditions:
    success: "All CI checks pass with no new failures detected"
    max_waves: "Limit to 8 waves to prevent infinite remediation cycles"
    confidence_floor: "Stop if confidence drops below 75% for safety"
```

**Remediation Wave Examples**:

- **Wave 3**: Initial fixes pass, but CI reveals test environment issues
- **Wave 4**: Environment fixes applied, CI discovers dependency version conflicts
- **Wave 5**: Dependencies resolved, CI exposes security policy violations
- **Wave 6**: Security fixes applied, CI shows performance regression
- **Wave 7**: Performance optimizations completed, all CI checks finally pass

### Enhanced Pattern Recognition with Multi-Agent Confidence

  Dependencies:
    base_confidence: 92%
    agent_weights:
      platform-engineer: 0.5
      devops: 0.3
      debugger: 0.2
    consensus_multiplier: 1.0-1.15

      test-engineer: 0.6
      debugger: 0.25
      code-reviewer: 0.15

    base_confidence: 60%
    agent_weights:
      debugger: 0.4
      execution-evaluator: 0.3
      platform-engineer: 0.2
      devops: 0.1
    consensus_multiplier: 1.0-1.3 (critical for complex issues)
```
