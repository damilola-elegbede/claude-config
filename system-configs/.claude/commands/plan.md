# /plan Command

## Description

Enters plan mode to generate comprehensive strategic requirements and tactical
implementation plans. Presents a preview for approval before writing any files.
Creates a roadmap of small, focused PRs that can be developed in parallel when
possible, with each PR independently reviewable and following TDD methodology.

## Usage

```bash
/plan <task_description>
/plan simple <task_description>  # For tasks <100 LOC
/plan --file <file_path>         # Read task from file
/plan -f <file_path>             # Read task from file (short form)
/plan simple --file <file_path>  # Simple mode with file input
/plan simple -f <file_path>      # Simple mode with file input (short form)
```yaml

## Command Execution Flow

### Plan Mode Entry

When you invoke `/plan`, I will:

1. **Enter plan mode** immediately to begin strategic planning
2. **Read file if provided** with --file or -f flag, otherwise use provided description
3. **Analyze task complexity** from file content or description
4. **Generate a complete plan** in memory without writing any files
5. **Present a preview** for your review and approval
6. **Stay in plan mode** while waiting for your decision
7. **Exit plan mode** ONLY after you approve using ExitPlanMode tool
8. **Write files only if approved** - no files created until you confirm
9. **Deploy execution-evaluator** to verify:
   - Plan generated successfully
   - Complexity assessment accurate
   - PR breakdown logical and independent
   - Files written match approved plan
   - No unauthorized files created

### File Input Processing

When using `--file <file_path>` or `-f <file_path>`:

1. **Read the entire file** using the Read tool
2. **Extract requirements** from the file content
3. **Parse structured formats** (Markdown, YAML, JSON, plain text)
4. **Identify task objectives** from:
   - User stories or requirements lists
   - Technical specifications
   - Bug reports or issue descriptions
   - Feature requests
   - Architecture documents
5. **Generate plan** based solely on file content
6. **Ignore conversation context** when --file or -f is used (file is the sole source)

**Supported File Formats**:
- `.md` - Markdown specifications
- `.txt` - Plain text requirements
- `.yaml`/`.yml` - Structured task definitions
- `.json` - JSON task specifications
- `.rst` - reStructuredText documents
- Any text-based format with clear requirements

### Complexity Assessment

I determine complexity based on task indicators and estimated lines of code:

- **Simple** (<100 LOC): Single PR, minimal orchestration
  - Keywords: button, typo, color, text change, label, tooltip
  - Example: "Fix login button text"

- **Medium** (100-1000 LOC): 2-3 phases, 4-7 PRs
  - Keywords: feature, endpoint, component, integration
  - Example: "Add user profile page"

- **Complex** (>1000 LOC): Full phase breakdown, 8+ PRs
  - Keywords: system, migration, architecture, redesign, platform
  - Example: "Implement authentication system"

Use `simple` keyword to force simple mode for quick tasks.

### Agent Selection Process

Based on task requirements, I will:

1. **Consult principal-architect** to determine technical approach
2. **Identify required specialists** based on task domain
3. **Assign project-orchestrator** for complex multi-phase work
4. **Include appropriate reviewers** (always includes code-reviewer)
5. **Optimize for parallel execution** when possible

Common agent patterns:

- **Feature development**: backend-engineer + frontend-architect + test-engineer
- **Bug fixes**: debugger + test-engineer + code-reviewer
- **Performance issues**: performance-specialist + monitoring-specialist
- **Security features**: security-auditor + backend-engineer + code-reviewer
- **Documentation**: tech-writer + codebase-analyst

### Plan Preview Format

Before writing any files, I present a comprehensive preview including:

- **Task Summary**: Description, complexity, total phases and PRs
- **Time Estimates**: Sequential vs parallel execution times
- **Agent Assignments**: Lead architects, specialists, and reviewers
- **Phase Breakdown**: Detailed PR structure with assignments
- **Parallel Opportunities**: Which PRs can run concurrently
- **Files to Generate**: Complete list of files that will be created
- **Risk Assessment**: Identified risks and mitigation strategies

### Approval Workflow

After presenting the preview:

**IMPORTANT**: Stay IN plan mode while waiting for approval. Only exit plan mode AFTER receiving user approval.

1. **Present plan and wait** (still in plan mode):
   - Show the complete plan preview
   - Remain in plan mode while awaiting user decision
   - Do NOT exit plan mode yet
2. **Process user response**:
   - **"yes" or approval**: Exit plan mode with ExitPlanMode tool, then write files
   - **"modify" or changes**: Stay in plan mode, adjust plan and re-present
   - **"cancel" or rejection**: Exit plan mode without writing files
3. **Execute based on decision**:
   - On approval: Use ExitPlanMode with the approved plan, then write files
   - On modify: Generate new preview with requested changes (stay in plan mode)
   - On cancel: Use ExitPlanMode to exit cleanly without creating files
4. **Report completion**: Show where files were written (if approved)

## Approval Indicators

The command recognizes these approval signals:

### Positive Approval

- "yes" - Standard approval
- "approve" - Formal approval
- "proceed" - Go ahead approval
- "üëç" - Emoji approval
- "looks good" - Informal approval
- "generate" - Direct generation request
- "create files" - Explicit file creation request

### Modification Requests

- "modify" - Request changes
- "update" - Request updates
- "change" - Request modifications
- "revise" - Request revision
- "adjust" - Request adjustments

### Rejection Signals

- "no" - Standard rejection
- "cancel" - Cancellation request
- "abort" - Abort operation
- "stop" - Stop processing
- "reject" - Formal rejection
- "üëé" - Emoji rejection

## Strategic Plan Format

The strategic plan includes:

1. **Executive Summary** - High-level overview and objectives
2. **Requirements Analysis** - Business and technical requirements
3. **Success Criteria** - Measurable outcomes
4. **Risk Assessment** - Potential challenges and mitigations
5. **Architectural Decisions** - Technology choices and patterns
6. **Phased implementation** - TDD methodology with parallel execution opportunities

### File Generation Strategy

When approved, files are written to `.tmp/<feature-name>/`:

**Simple tasks** generate:

- `implementation.md` - Single PR with all changes

**Complex tasks** generate:

- `plan.md` - Strategic requirements document
- `phase_1.01_<description>.md` - Phase 1, PR 1
- `phase_1.02_<description>.md` - Phase 1, PR 2
- `phase_1.03_<description>.md` - Phase 1, PR 3
- `phase_2.01_<description>.md` - Phase 2, PR 1
- `phase_2.02_<description>.md` - Phase 2, PR 2
- (continues for all PRs with phase_X.YY_description.md format)
- `rollback.md` - Rollback procedures

### PR File Contents (Detailed Task Descriptions)

Each PR file (`phase_X.YY_description.md`) contains comprehensive task breakdowns:

#### Required Sections in Each PR File

1. **PR Metadata**
   - Title, estimated LOC, dependencies
   - Required reviewers and merge order

2. **Detailed Task Breakdown**
   - **Granular task list** with specific implementation steps
   - **Task IDs** for tracking (e.g., T1.01.01, T1.01.02)
   - **Assigned agents** for each task
   - **Time estimates** per task (in minutes)
   - **Dependencies** between tasks
   - **Acceptance criteria** for each task

3. **Parallel Execution Plan**
   - Which tasks can run simultaneously
   - Critical path identification
   - Time savings from parallelization

4. **Implementation Details**
   - **Specific code changes** required
   - **File-by-file modifications**
   - **Exact functions/methods** to add or modify
   - **Database changes** if applicable
   - **Configuration updates** needed
   - **Test cases** to implement

5. **Review Requirements**
   - Specific reviewers needed
   - Areas requiring special attention
   - Security considerations
   - Performance implications

Example task detail level:

```text
Task T1.02.03: Implement password hashing in User model
- Agent: backend-engineer
- Time: 25-30 minutes
- Dependencies: T1.02.01 (User schema complete)
- Details:
  * Add bcrypt dependency to package.json
  * Create pre-save hook in src/models/User.js
  * Hash password with 12 rounds
  * Add comparePassword method
  * Never expose raw password in JSON
- Acceptance: Password stored as hash, comparison works
```yaml

### Phase Organization

Phases follow a logical progression:

1. **Phase 1 - Test Foundation**: Test infrastructure and TDD setup
2. **Phase 2 - Core Implementation**: Main functionality
3. **Phase 3 - Integration**: Service integration and validation

Within each phase:

- PRs are numbered sequentially (1.01, 1.02, 1.03...)
- Dependencies are clearly marked
- Parallel execution opportunities identified
- Each PR is independently mergeable

### Error Handling

If issues occur during planning:

- **File not found**: Report error and request valid file path
- **File unreadable**: Check permissions and file format
- **Empty file**: Inform user that file contains no requirements
- **Binary file**: Reject non-text files, request text-based input
- **Agent unavailable**: Use fallback agents with similar expertise
- **Complexity overflow**: Auto-split into smaller manageable tasks
- **PR too large**: Break down into multiple smaller PRs
- **Circular dependencies**: Serialize execution order
- **Planning timeout**: Fall back to simple mode

After 3 failed attempts, generate a simple single-file plan as fallback.

## Benefits of Plan Mode

### Why Preview Before Writing

1. **No wasted files**: Files only created after approval
2. **User control**: Review and approve before resource commitment
3. **Iterative refinement**: Modify requirements without file cleanup
4. **Transparency**: See exactly what will be created
5. **Resource efficiency**: Avoid generating 15+ files for misunderstood requirements
6. **Clear expectations**: Know scope, complexity, and deliverables upfront

### Comparison

| Aspect | Without Preview | With Preview (Plan Mode) |
|--------|----------------|-------------------------|
| File Generation | Immediate | After approval only |
| User Control | Limited | Full control |
| Mistakes | Manual cleanup | Just cancel |
| Iteration | Delete and regenerate | Review and modify |
| Transparency | After the fact | Before generation |

## Arguments

- `task_description` (optional): Direct task description or requirements
- `simple` (optional): Forces simple mode for tasks <100 LOC
- `--file <file_path>` or `-f <file_path>` (optional): Path to file containing task requirements

**Note**: When using `--file` or `-f`, the file content becomes the sole source of requirements. Any additional task description is ignored.

## Behavior

The /plan command follows these behavioral patterns:

### Planning Phase

1. **Immediate plan mode entry**: Switches to strategic planning mode
2. **Comprehensive analysis**: Evaluates task complexity and requirements
3. **Agent orchestration**: Identifies optimal agent assignments
4. **Preview generation**: Creates detailed plan preview without writing files
5. **Approval waiting**: Pauses for explicit user confirmation

### Execution Phase

1. **File generation**: Only occurs after explicit approval
2. **Structured output**: Writes files to `.tmp/<feature-name>/` directory
3. **Progress reporting**: Shows exactly where files were created
4. **Error handling**: Gracefully handles planning failures with fallbacks

### Quality Assurance

1. **TDD methodology**: Emphasizes test-driven development patterns
2. **Phased implementation**: Breaks complex work into manageable phases
3. **Parallel optimization**: Identifies concurrent execution opportunities
4. **Review requirements**: Specifies required reviewers and quality gates

### User Control

1. **Preview first**: Never writes files without approval
2. **Iterative refinement**: Supports plan modifications before generation
3. **Cancellation support**: Allows aborting without file creation
4. **Transparency**: Shows complete plan structure before execution

## Notes

- Plan mode ensures no files are written without explicit approval for ALL tasks (including simple ones)
- All planning happens in memory until approval is received
- Complex plans can involve 10+ PR files but are only written if approved
- The preview checkpoint prevents filesystem clutter
- Users maintain full control over the planning process for both simple and complex tasks
- Supports iterative refinement without generating unwanted files
- **Even simple tasks require explicit approval before file generation**
- **File input**: When using `--file` or `-f`, the file content is the sole source of truth for requirements
- **File formats**: Any text-based file with clear requirements can be used as input
- **Absolute paths**: File paths can be relative or absolute
- **Large files**: The entire file is read, so very large files may take longer to process
