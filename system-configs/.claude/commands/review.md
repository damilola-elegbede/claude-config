# /review Command

## Description

Multi-agent code review with comprehensive documentation analysis for context,
orchestrating specialized agents for security, performance, testing, and
accessibility validation.

## Usage

```bash
/review                    # Review changed files only (default)
/review --full             # Review entire codebase comprehensively
/review <file|directory>   # Review specific target
/review --fix             # Auto-fix safe issues
/review --security        # Security-focused review
/review --performance     # Performance-focused review
```

## Behavior

When invoked, I first read all documentation for context understanding, then
orchestrate multiple specialized agents for code review. By default, only
changed files are reviewed for efficiency. Agents receive documentation context
and work in parallel to analyze security, performance, testing, and accessibility
aspects with informed decisions.

**Default Mode**: Reviews only changed files (git diff) for fast feedback
**Full Mode**: Reviews entire repository for comprehensive system analysis

## Agent Orchestration Strategy

### Standard Review (default - changed files only)

**Scope**: Reviews files changed in current branch (git diff main...HEAD)

**Parallel Agent Deployment:**

```yaml
Always Deployed:
  code-reviewer: "Code quality, patterns, maintainability analysis"
  security-auditor: "OWASP compliance, vulnerability detection"

Conditionally Deployed:
  test-engineer: "If test files present or coverage gaps detected"
  performance-specialist: "If performance issues or slow code detected"
  accessibility-auditor: "If frontend/UI files present (.jsx, .vue, .html)"

Coordination: All agents work simultaneously, results aggregated by severity
```

### Full Repository Review (--full mode)

**Scope**: Reviews entire codebase for comprehensive system analysis

**Extended Agent Deployment:**

```yaml
Core Quality:
  code-reviewer: "Repository-wide code quality analysis"
  security-auditor: "Complete security audit"
  performance-specialist: "System-wide performance analysis"

Infrastructure:
  devops: "CI/CD pipeline and deployment analysis"
  dependency-analyst: "Supply chain and dependency security"
  database-admin: "Database schema and performance review"

Testing & Documentation:
  test-engineer: "Complete test coverage and quality analysis"
  tech-writer: "Documentation completeness and accuracy"
  accessibility-auditor: "Comprehensive accessibility compliance"

Coordination: Comprehensive multi-domain analysis with executive summary
```

### Focused Reviews

```yaml
--security Mode:
  scope: "Changed files or full repository based on base command"
  agents: [security-auditor, code-reviewer]
  focus: "OWASP Top 10, dependency vulnerabilities, secrets"

--performance Mode:
  scope: "Changed files or full repository based on base command"
  agents: [performance-specialist, code-reviewer]
  focus: "Algorithm complexity, database queries, memory usage"

--fix Mode:
  scope: "Changed files only (safety requirement)"
  agents: [code-reviewer + auto-remediation specialists]
  behavior: "Auto-apply safe fixes, report non-automatable issues"
```

## Review Categories & Examples

### Code Quality Issues

**Real Examples:**

```javascript
// ‚ùå Critical: Null pointer exception
function getUserEmail(user) {
  return user.email.toLowerCase(); // user could be null
}

// ‚úÖ Fixed: Null safety
function getUserEmail(user) {
  return user?.email?.toLowerCase() || '';
}

// ‚ùå High: O(n¬≤) complexity
function findDuplicates(arr) {
  const duplicates = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    for (let j = i + 1; j < arr.length; j++) {
      if (arr[i] === arr[j]) duplicates.push(arr[i]);
    }
  }
  return duplicates;
}

// ‚úÖ Fixed: O(n) complexity
function findDuplicates(arr) {
  const seen = new Set();
  const duplicates = new Set();
  for (const item of arr) {
    if (seen.has(item)) duplicates.add(item);
    seen.add(item);
  }
  return Array.from(duplicates);
}
```

### Security Vulnerabilities

**Real Examples:**

```javascript
// ‚ùå Critical: SQL injection
const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${userId}`;

// ‚úÖ Fixed: Parameterized query
const query = 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?';
db.query(query, [userId]);

// ‚ùå High: XSS vulnerability
document.innerHTML = `<div>${userInput}</div>`;

// ‚úÖ Fixed: Proper escaping
document.textContent = userInput; // or use DOMPurify
```

### Performance Issues

**Real Examples:**

```python
# ‚ùå High: N+1 query problem
def get_user_posts(user_ids):
    users = []
    for user_id in user_ids:
        user = User.objects.get(id=user_id)  # N queries
        posts = Post.objects.filter(user=user)  # N more queries
        users.append({'user': user, 'posts': posts})
    return users

# ‚úÖ Fixed: Single query with prefetch
def get_user_posts(user_ids):
    return User.objects.filter(id__in=user_ids)\
                      .prefetch_related('posts')\
                      .values('id', 'name', 'posts__title')
```

### Test Coverage Gaps

**Real Examples:**

```javascript
// ‚ùå High: Critical function untested
function processPayment(amount, cardToken) {
  if (amount <= 0) throw new Error('Invalid amount');
  return chargeCard(cardToken, amount);
}
// No tests exist for this critical payment function

// ‚úÖ Required: Comprehensive test coverage
describe('processPayment', () => {
  test('throws error for negative amounts', () => {
    expect(() => processPayment(-10, 'token')).toThrow('Invalid amount');
  });

  test('throws error for zero amounts', () => {
    expect(() => processPayment(0, 'token')).toThrow('Invalid amount');
  });

  test('processes valid payment', async () => {
    const result = await processPayment(100, 'valid-token');
    expect(result.success).toBe(true);
  });
});
```

## Review Report Examples

### Security-Focused Review

```markdown
## Security Review Report
**Target**: src/auth/ | **Issues**: 3 Critical, 2 High | **Status**: ‚ùå Blocked

### üî¥ Critical Security Issues
1. **SQL Injection** in `auth/login.js:45`
   - **Risk**: Remote code execution via login form
   - **Fix**: Use parameterized queries: `db.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ?', [email])`

2. **Hardcoded JWT Secret** in `config/jwt.js:12`
   - **Risk**: Token forgery if secret leaked
   - **Fix**: Move to environment variable: `process.env.JWT_SECRET`

### üü† High Priority Issues
1. **Weak Password Hashing** in `auth/password.js:23`
   - **Current**: MD5 hashing (cryptographically broken)
   - **Fix**: Use bcrypt with salt rounds ‚â•12

### ‚úÖ Security Strengths
- CSRF protection properly implemented
- Input validation present on all endpoints
- HTTPS enforcement configured

### üéØ Recommendations
1. Implement rate limiting on authentication endpoints
2. Add logging for failed authentication attempts
3. Consider implementing 2FA for admin accounts
```

### Performance Review

```markdown
## Performance Review Report
**Target**: src/api/ | **Issues**: 1 High, 3 Medium | **Estimated Impact**: 60% response time reduction

### üü† High Impact Issues
1. **N+1 Query Problem** in `api/users.js:67`
   - **Current**: 1 + N database queries for user list
   - **Impact**: 2000ms response time with 100 users
   - **Fix**: Use `JOIN` or `prefetch_related()`: reduces to 50ms

### üü° Medium Impact Issues
1. **Inefficient Array Operations** in `utils/search.js:34`
   - **Current**: O(n¬≤) nested loops for filtering
   - **Fix**: Use `Set` for O(n) lookup: `const seen = new Set()`

2. **Excessive Bundle Size** in `frontend/components/`
   - **Current**: 2.3MB JavaScript bundle
   - **Fix**: Code splitting and lazy loading: reduces to 400KB initial

### üìä Performance Metrics
- **Database Queries**: 15 ‚Üí 3 (80% reduction)
- **Memory Usage**: 150MB ‚Üí 90MB (40% reduction)
- **Bundle Size**: 2.3MB ‚Üí 400KB (83% reduction)
```

### Test Coverage Review

```markdown
## Test Coverage Review
**Target**: src/ | **Coverage**: 67% ‚Üí Target: 80% | **Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs Improvement

### ‚ùå Critical Gaps (Untested)
1. **Payment Processing** (`payments/charge.js`)
   - 0% coverage on critical financial logic
   - **Required**: Unit tests for validation, error handling, success flows

2. **Authentication Logic** (`auth/validate.js`)
   - Missing edge case tests (expired tokens, malformed input)
   - **Required**: Integration tests for auth flow

### üìà Coverage Improvements Needed
- **Current Coverage**: 67% lines, 45% branches
- **Missing Tests**: 23 functions lack any test coverage
- **Flaky Tests**: 3 tests fail intermittently

### ‚úÖ Well-Tested Areas
- User management: 95% coverage with edge cases
- API routing: 88% coverage with integration tests
- Database models: 92% coverage with mocking

### üéØ Action Plan
1. Add comprehensive payment tests (highest priority)
2. Improve authentication test coverage to 90%
3. Fix flaky tests in user registration flow
4. Add property-based testing for data validation
```
