# /docs Command

## Usage

```bash
/docs                    # Progressive documentation enhancement (3 waves)
/docs --audit            # Wave 1 gap analysis only
/docs --clean            # Clean temporary docs and organize
/docs api                # Focused API documentation update
/docs readme             # README.md refresh only
/docs architecture       # System design docs only
/docs setup              # Installation and setup docs
```

## Description

Progressive documentation enhancement system using wave-based orchestration. Identifies gaps systematically, generates
documentation in parallel waves, and applies quality enhancement passes. Each wave includes quality gates to ensure
comprehensive coverage and excellence.

**IMPORTANT: This command explicitly excludes all CLAUDE.md files from any operations.** CLAUDE.md files at any level
(root directory, home directory, project directory, or nested locations) are never read, written, modified, or
analyzed by the /docs command. These configuration files are protected system files that must remain untouched
during documentation operations.

## Protected Files

The following files are **NEVER** touched, read, written, or modified by the /docs command:

- **CLAUDE.md** (any location: root, home, project, nested directories)
- **~/.claude/CLAUDE.md** (home directory configuration)
- **./CLAUDE.md** (project root configuration)
- **Any path containing CLAUDE.md** (all nested locations)

These files contain critical system configurations and agent orchestration instructions that must remain isolated
from documentation generation processes.

      - instance_2: Backend services, API endpoints, data models
      - instance_3: Infrastructure, deployment, configuration docs
    role: Identify undocumented code sections and missing documentation
    exclusions: All CLAUDE.md files at any level are skipped during scanning
    output: Comprehensive gap inventory with priority rankings
    protection: CLAUDE.md files never included in analysis or recommendations

  tech-writer (assessment instance):
    role: Evaluate existing documentation quality and structure
    parallel_with: [codebase-analyst instances]
    focus: Content quality, organization, clarity, completeness
    exclusions: CLAUDE.md files are never assessed or modified
    output: Quality assessment with improvement recommendations

  api-architect:
    role: Assess API documentation completeness and accuracy
    parallel_with: [codebase-analyst instances, tech-writer]
    focus: OpenAPI specs, endpoint coverage, schema documentation
    exclusions: CLAUDE.md files are never analyzed for API documentation needs
