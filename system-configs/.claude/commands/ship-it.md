# /ship-it Command

## Description

Instructs Claude to execute a development workflow by running multiple Claude commands in sequence.
Leverages Claude's full intelligence and agent orchestration for each step.

## Usage

```bash
/ship-it                    # Full workflow (default)
/ship-it --basic            # Basic workflow
/ship-it --quick            # Quick workflow
```

## Workflows

```text
Full (Default): /commit ‚Üí /review ‚Üí /test ‚Üí /push --simple ‚Üí /pr (if no PR exists)
Basic: /commit ‚Üí /review --quick ‚Üí /push --simple
Quick: /commit ‚Üí /push --simple
```

## Behavior

When invoked, I will execute a sequence of Claude commands with full agent orchestration.
Each command runs with complete context awareness, specialized agents, and quality gates.
The workflow continues sequentially with **automatic issue resolution** - when commands report
problems, I deploy appropriate agents to fix them and retry until success.

## Execution Logic

```bash
ship_it() {
  local workflow="${1:-full}"

  echo "üöÄ Starting ship-it workflow: $workflow"
  echo ""

  case "$workflow" in
    "quick")
      echo "I will now execute the Quick workflow:"
      echo "1. /commit - Stage changes and create commit (no review)"
      echo "2. /push --simple - Safe repository operations with basic validation"
      ;;
    "basic")
      echo "I will now execute the Basic workflow:"
      echo "1. /commit - Stage changes and create commit with semantic messaging"
      echo "2. /review --quick - Quick code review with essential checks on staged commit"
      echo "3. /push --simple - Safe repository operations (review already done)"
      ;;
    "full"|*)
      echo "I will now execute the Full workflow:"
      echo "1. /commit - Stage changes and create commit with semantic messaging"
      echo "2. /review - Multi-agent code analysis with comprehensive quality gates on staged commit"
      echo "3. /test - Intelligent test discovery and execution with framework detection"
      echo "4. /push --simple - Safe repository operations (review already done)"
      echo "5. /pr - Intelligent PR creation with context-aware descriptions (if no PR exists)"
      ;;
  esac
  echo ""
  echo "Each command will use Claude's full intelligence with:"
  echo "‚Ä¢ Agent orchestration and specialized expertise"
  echo "‚Ä¢ Context awareness and quality gates"
  echo "‚Ä¢ Automatic issue resolution (deploy agents to fix problems)"
  echo "‚Ä¢ Retry failed steps until success (except /pr which is non-fatal)"
  echo ""
  echo "Ready to begin the workflow."
}
```

## Automatic Issue Resolution

When commands report problems, I automatically deploy appropriate agents to resolve them:

### /commit Issues
```text
Staging conflicts: Use git-workflow-specialist to resolve merge issues
Temp file cleanup: Execute cleanup and retry commit
Pre-commit hooks fail: Apply fixes from hooks and retry commit
Large files detected: Use .gitignore rules and retry
```

### /review Issues
```text
Security vulnerabilities: Deploy security-auditor ‚Üí fix issues ‚Üí retry
Performance problems: Deploy performance-specialist ‚Üí optimize ‚Üí retry
Code quality issues: Deploy code-reviewer + specialists ‚Üí remediate ‚Üí retry
Test coverage gaps: Deploy test-engineer ‚Üí add tests ‚Üí retry
Documentation missing: Deploy tech-writer ‚Üí generate docs ‚Üí retry
```

### /test Issues
```text
Test failures: Deploy test-engineer ‚Üí fix failing tests ‚Üí retry
Coverage too low: Deploy test-engineer ‚Üí add missing tests ‚Üí retry
Test env issues: Deploy devops ‚Üí fix environment ‚Üí retry
Dependencies missing: Install requirements ‚Üí retry
```

### /push Issues
```text
Pre-push hooks fail: Apply hook fixes ‚Üí commit fixes ‚Üí retry push
Linting failures: Auto-fix with formatters ‚Üí commit ‚Üí retry push
Merge conflicts: Deploy git-workflow-specialist ‚Üí resolve ‚Üí retry
Branch protection: Create PR instead of direct push
Network failures: Retry with exponential backoff
```

### /pr Issues
```text
Template missing: Generate PR template ‚Üí retry
Description incomplete: Deploy tech-writer ‚Üí enhance description ‚Üí retry
Branch conflicts: Deploy git-workflow-specialist ‚Üí resolve ‚Üí retry
CI checks failing: Wait for checks ‚Üí deploy specialists if needed
```

## Resolution Strategies

### Progressive Problem Solving
1. **Identify Issue**: Parse command output for specific error patterns
2. **Deploy Specialist**: Route to appropriate agent based on error type
3. **Apply Fixes**: Let agent implement solutions automatically
4. **Verify Resolution**: Re-run original command to confirm success
5. **Continue Workflow**: Move to next step once resolved

### Agent Routing Logic
```text
Security Issues ‚Üí security-auditor (always, non-negotiable)
Performance Issues ‚Üí performance-specialist + monitoring-specialist
Code Quality ‚Üí code-reviewer + backend-engineer/frontend-architect
Testing Issues ‚Üí test-engineer + execution-evaluator
Git Issues ‚Üí git-workflow-specialist + execution-evaluator
Infrastructure ‚Üí devops + platform-engineer
Documentation ‚Üí tech-writer
Dependencies ‚Üí dependency-analyst + package managers
```

### Retry Patterns
```text
Transient Failures: Retry up to 3 times with backoff
Fix-and-Retry: Apply fixes, commit if needed, then retry original command
Agent-Mediated: Deploy specialist ‚Üí verify fix ‚Üí retry original
Escalation: If 3 attempts fail, surface to user with analysis
```

## Examples

### Full Workflow

```bash
User: /ship-it
Claude: üöÄ Starting ship-it workflow: full

I will now execute the Full workflow:
1. /commit - Stage changes and create commit with semantic messaging
2. /review - Multi-agent code analysis with comprehensive quality gates on staged commit
3. /test - Intelligent test discovery and execution with framework detection
4. /push --simple - Safe repository operations (review already done)
5. /pr - Intelligent PR creation with context-aware descriptions (if no PR exists)

Each command will use Claude's full intelligence with:
‚Ä¢ Agent orchestration and specialized expertise
‚Ä¢ Context awareness and quality gates
‚Ä¢ Automatic issue resolution (deploy agents to fix problems)
‚Ä¢ Retry failed steps until success (except /pr which is non-fatal)

Ready to begin the workflow.

[Claude executes /commit successfully]
[Claude executes /review - finds 3 security issues]
ü§ñ Deploying security-auditor to fix vulnerabilities...
‚úÖ Security issues resolved, committing fixes
[Claude retries /review - all checks pass]
[Claude executes /test - 2 tests failing]
ü§ñ Deploying test-engineer to fix failing tests...
‚úÖ Tests fixed and passing
[Claude executes /push --simple successfully]
[Claude executes /pr successfully]
```

### Basic Workflow

```bash

I will now execute the Basic workflow:
1. /commit - Stage changes and create commit with semantic messaging
2. /review --quick - Quick code review with essential checks on staged commit
3. /push --simple - Safe repository operations (review already done)

Each command will use Claude's full intelligence with:
‚Ä¢ Agent orchestration and specialized expertise
‚Ä¢ Context awareness and quality gates
‚Ä¢ Automatic issue resolution (deploy agents to fix problems)
‚Ä¢ Retry failed steps until success (except /pr which is non-fatal)

Ready to begin the workflow.
```

### Quick Workflow

```bash
User: /ship-it --quick
Claude: üöÄ Starting ship-it workflow: quick

I will now execute the Quick workflow:
1. /commit - Stage changes and create commit (no review)
2. /push --simple - Safe repository operations with basic validation

Each command will use Claude's full intelligence with:
‚Ä¢ Agent orchestration and specialized expertise
‚Ä¢ Context awareness and quality gates
‚Ä¢ Automatic issue resolution (deploy agents to fix problems)
‚Ä¢ Retry failed steps until success (except /pr which is non-fatal)

Ready to begin the workflow.
```

### Problem Resolution Example

```bash
User: /ship-it
Claude: üöÄ Starting ship-it workflow: full

[Claude executes /commit successfully]
[Claude executes /review - finds linting issues]
ü§ñ Deploying code-reviewer + frontend-architect for auto-remediation...
‚úÖ Linting issues fixed, committing remediation
[Claude retries /review - all checks pass]
[Claude executes /test successfully]
[Claude executes /push --simple - pre-push hooks fail]
‚ö†Ô∏è Pre-push hooks failed: ESLint errors detected
ü§ñ Applying ESLint auto-fixes...
üìù Committing hook fixes
[Claude retries /push --simple successfully]
[Claude executes /pr successfully]

üéâ Full workflow completed with automatic issue resolution
```
