# /push Command

## Usage

```bash
/push                   # Wave-based orchestration push
/push --simple          # Quick push without quality checks
/push --force           # Force push (use carefully)
/push --dry-run         # Preview what would be pushed
```

## Description

Safely pushes changes to remote repository using advanced wave-based orchestration for comprehensive
quality gates, auto-recovery, and CI/CD monitoring. Deploys specialized agents in three coordinated
waves with automatic issue resolution between phases.

**CRITICAL**: This command NEVER uses `--no-verify`. Pre-push hooks are the last line of
defense before code reaches the remote repository. If pre-push hooks fail, the issues must
be fixed immediately, never bypassed.

## Wave-Based Orchestration

### Wave 1: Pre-Push Validation (Parallel)

Simultaneous quality gate validation with three specialized agents:

```yaml
Parallel Agent Deployment:
  - test-engineer: Complete test suite execution and coverage analysis
  - devops: CI/CD readiness check and pipeline validation
  - security-auditor: Security vulnerability scanning and compliance check

Execution: All agents run simultaneously for maximum efficiency
Duration: 15-30 seconds (parallel execution)
```

**Claude Analysis Phase**: Identifies blocking issues and determines if Wave 2 is needed

### Wave 2: Issue Resolution (Conditional)

Deployed only when Wave 1 identifies blocking issues:

```yaml
Conditional Agent Deployment:
  - test-engineer: Fix failing tests and coverage issues
  - devops: Resolve CI/CD configuration issues and pipeline problems
  - security-auditor: Fix security vulnerabilities and compliance issues
  - platform-engineer: Fix environment setup and dependency conflicts

Auto-Recovery Logic:
  - Pre-push hook failures ‚Üí Deploy appropriate fix agents
  - Test failures ‚Üí Deploy test-engineer for fixes
  - Security issues ‚Üí Deploy security-auditor for remediation
  - Build failures ‚Üí Deploy devops for pipeline fixes

Execution: Targeted parallel deployment based on issue types
Duration: 20-45 seconds (varies by issue complexity)
```

**Claude Verification Phase**: Confirms all issues resolved and system ready to push

### Wave 3: Push & Monitor

Execute push operation with real-time monitoring:

```yaml
Push Execution:
  - Execute git push with quality gate enforcement
  - Real-time CI/CD pipeline monitoring
  - Automatic failure detection and classification

Auto-Recovery for Push Failures:
  - Pipeline failures ‚Üí Deploy devops for immediate fixes
  - Build failures ‚Üí Deploy platform-engineer for environment issues
  - Test failures ‚Üí Deploy test-engineer for fix and retry

Monitoring Duration: Until CI/CD pipeline completes or fails
```

## Behavior

### Wave-Based Execution Strategy

#### Default Mode - Full Wave Orchestration

**What it does**: Three-wave orchestration with auto-recovery

```yaml
Wave 1 - Pre-Push Validation (Always):
  Parallel Agents: test-engineer + devops + security-auditor
  Purpose: Comprehensive quality gate validation
  Duration: 15-30 seconds

Wave 2 - Issue Resolution (Conditional):
  Triggered: When Wave 1 detects blocking issues
  Parallel Agents: test-engineer + devops + security-auditor + platform-engineer
  Purpose: Auto-resolve all detected issues
  Duration: 20-45 seconds

Wave 3 - Push & Monitor (Always):
  Purpose: Execute push with real-time CI/CD monitoring
  Auto-Recovery: Deploy fix agents for pipeline failures
  Duration: Until pipeline completion
```

#### Simple Mode (--simple) - Direct Push

**What it does**: Skip orchestration, direct push with basic checks

```yaml
Operations:
  - Basic safety validation only
  - No agent deployment
  - Direct git push execution
  - No auto-recovery mechanisms

Duration: 10-15 seconds
Use Case: Hot fixes, emergency pushes
```

### Auto-Recovery Mechanisms

#### Pre-Push Hook Failure Recovery

```yaml
Failure Detection:
  - Parse pre-push hook error output
  - Classify issue type (testing, security, build, CI/CD)
  - Deploy appropriate specialist agents

Recovery Agents:
  - Test failures ‚Üí test-engineer with debugging capability
  - Security issues ‚Üí security-auditor with remediation
  - Build/CI issues ‚Üí devops with pipeline expertise
  - Environment issues ‚Üí platform-engineer with config fixes

Recovery Process:
  1. Identify root cause of pre-push failure
  2. Deploy targeted agent(s) for resolution
  3. Re-validate with original failing checks
  4. Retry push operation automatically
```

#### CI/CD Pipeline Failure Recovery

```yaml
Pipeline Monitoring:
  - Real-time status checking every 30 seconds
  - Automatic failure classification when detected
  - Immediate deployment of recovery agents

Recovery Types:
  - Build failures ‚Üí platform-engineer for environment fixes
  - Test failures ‚Üí test-engineer for flaky test resolution
  - Deployment failures ‚Üí devops for infrastructure issues
  - Security gate failures ‚Üí security-auditor for compliance fixes

Recovery Timeline:
  - Detection: Within 30 seconds of failure
  - Agent deployment: Immediate parallel execution
  - Resolution attempt: 2-5 minutes depending on complexity
  - Retry mechanism: Automatic with exponential backoff
```

### Quality Gate Enforcement

#### Never Bypass Philosophy

```yaml
Prohibited Practices:
  - NEVER use: git push --no-verify
  - NEVER bypass: pre-push hooks without resolution
  - NEVER skip: security or quality validations
  - NEVER force push: without explicit team coordination

Wave-Based Approach Instead:
  - Fix issues through agent deployment
  - Auto-resolve wherever possible
  - Escalate complex issues with detailed reports
  - Maintain audit trail of all resolution attempts
```

#### Issue Resolution Priority

```yaml
Priority 1 - Security Issues:
  - Immediate deployment of security-auditor
  - Block push until resolved
  - Require explicit confirmation for overrides

Priority 2 - Test Failures:
  - Deploy test-engineer for investigation
  - Attempt automated fixes for known patterns
  - Provide detailed failure analysis

Priority 3 - CI/CD Issues:
  - Deploy devops for pipeline diagnostics
  - Fix configuration and dependency issues
  - Update CI/CD definitions as needed

Priority 4 - Build/Environment Issues:
  - Deploy platform-engineer for system fixes
  - Fix dependency and environment conflicts
  - Update build configurations as needed
```

### Error Handling & Escalation

#### Automatic Retry Logic

```yaml
Retry Strategy:
  - Failed pre-push hooks: 2 retries with agent fixes
  - CI/CD pipeline failures: 3 retries with increasing delays
  - Network/connectivity issues: 5 retries with exponential backoff
  - Agent deployment failures: 2 retries with alternative agents

Escalation Triggers:
  - 3 consecutive push failures
  - Agent resolution failures across all retry attempts
  - Critical security issues requiring manual intervention
  - Infrastructure problems beyond agent capability
```

#### Failure Reporting

```yaml
Comprehensive Failure Reports:
  - Root cause analysis from deployed agents
  - Step-by-step resolution attempts
  - Remaining manual intervention requirements
  - Recommended next steps for developer

Report Delivery:
  - Immediate terminal output with actionable steps
  - Detailed log files in .tmp/logs/push-failures/
  - Integration with team notification systems
  - Automated issue creation for recurring problems
```

### Performance Optimization

#### Parallel Execution

```yaml
Wave 1 Parallelization:
  - All 3 validation agents run simultaneously
  - Shared result caching between agents
  - Early termination on critical failures
  - Resource-aware execution to prevent system overload

Wave 2 Efficiency:
  - Targeted agent deployment based on specific issues
  - Parallel execution of non-conflicting fixes
  - Incremental validation to avoid re-running successful checks
  - Smart dependency resolution between fix types
```

#### Resource Management

```yaml
System Considerations:
  - Maximum 5 concurrent agents to prevent overload
  - Intelligent queuing for resource-intensive operations
  - Memory and CPU usage monitoring during execution
  - Automatic scaling based on system capabilities
```
