# /prime Command

## Usage

```bash
/prime                          # Full comprehensive analysis with parallel agents
/prime --lite                   # Quick 2-second essential context
/prime authentication           # Deep component analysis with multi-instance
/prime api                      # Focused API architecture analysis
/prime "payment processing"     # Multi-instance component deep dive
```

## Description

Analyze repository structure, dependencies, and documentation to provide comprehensive project understanding.
Three modes: lite (quick), full (comprehensive), and focused (component-specific). Deploy parallel agents
for multi-instance analysis when needed.

## Expected Output

### Lite Mode Output (--lite, 2 seconds)

#### Focused Mode (<component>) - Multi-Instance Component Analysis

**What it does**: Deep component analysis using multiple agent instances

```yaml
Analysis Types:
  Architecture: "authentication service", "api architecture"
  Performance: "database queries", "frontend performance"
  Quality: "technical debt", "code quality"
  Security: "vulnerability assessment", "security review"

Multi-Instance Agent Deployment:
  codebase-analyst (instance pool):
    deployment: 3-5 instances for comprehensive component analysis
    calculation: min(5, complexity_of_component)
    distribution:
      - instance_1: File structure and organization analysis
      - instance_2: Dependency graph and integration mapping
      - instance_3: Code patterns and anti-pattern detection
      - instance_4: Performance bottleneck identification
      - instance_5: Technical debt and refactoring assessment
    parallel_execution: All aspects analyzed simultaneously

  specialized_agents:
    - security-auditor: For security-focused analysis
    - performance-engineer: For performance components
    - api-architect: For API architecture analysis
    parallel_with: [codebase-analyst instances]

Output Format:
  - Multi-perspective component analysis
  - Integration points from all instances
  - Consolidated technical debt report
  - Prioritized refactoring opportunities
  - Risk analysis from multiple angles
  - Executive summary with key findings

Performance Impact:
  - Sequential: 1-2 minutes for deep analysis
  - Multi-instance: 15-20 seconds (4-6x faster)
  - Comprehensive coverage: Multiple perspectives in parallel
```

### Execution Strategies

#### Multi-Instance Deployment Patterns

```yaml
Component Analysis with Instance Pools:
  "authentication" / "auth":
    agents: codebase-analyst (3 instances) + security-auditor
    focus: Authentication flow, session management, security assessment

  "database" / "data":
    agents: codebase-analyst (4 instances)
    focus: Schema design, query patterns, performance, data integrity

  "api" / "endpoints":
    agents: codebase-analyst (3 instances) + api-architect
    focus: Endpoint structure, request/response patterns, integration points

  "frontend" / "ui":
    agents: codebase-analyst (4 instances)
    focus: Component architecture, state management, performance, UI consistency

  "performance":
    agents: codebase-analyst (3 instances) + performance-engineer
    focus: Code bottlenecks, database performance, frontend optimization

  "security":
    agents: codebase-analyst (2 instances) + security-auditor
    focus: Vulnerability patterns, dependency security, comprehensive audit
```

#### Repository Size Strategy

- **Small repos** (<100 files): Direct analysis without agent overhead
- **Medium repos** (100-1000 files): Selective agent deployment
- **Large repos** (>1000 files): Full parallel agent deployment

### Performance & Optimization

#### Mode Comparison

| Mode | Duration | Resource Usage | Agent Deployment | Use Case |
|------|----------|----------------|------------------|----------|
| Lite | <2 seconds | Minimal | None | Quick status checks |
| Full | <5 seconds | Moderate | Large repos only | Project onboarding |
| Focused | 15-20 sec | Moderate-High | 3-5 instances | Deep component analysis |

#### Caching Strategy

Results cached for 1 hour based on git HEAD + date. Prevents repeated analysis of unchanged code
and improves performance for frequent context checks.
