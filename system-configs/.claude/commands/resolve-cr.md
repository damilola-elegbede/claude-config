# /resolve-cr Command

## Usage

```bash
/resolve-cr                # Interactive mode - fetch from PR (default)
/resolve-cr <pr-number>    # Specific PR
/resolve-cr --local        # Local mode - run CodeRabbit CLI on local changes
/resolve-cr --auto         # Auto-fix all recommended
/resolve-cr --dry-run      # Analysis only
```

## Description

Handles CodeRabbit feedback from two sources:

- **PR mode** (default): Fetches comments from existing GitHub PR
- **Local mode** (`--local`): Runs CodeRabbit CLI on local changes before PR exists

Both modes use the same interactive triage flow for fix/skip decisions.

## Behavior

### PR Mode (default)

1. **Fetch**: Multi-source discovery from 3 GitHub API endpoints
   - Inline review comments: `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr}/comments`
   - Review submissions: `gh pr view --json reviews`
   - PR discussion comments: `gh pr view --json comments`
   - Merge results and deduplicate by comment ID

2. **Evaluate**: Analyze each comment against project standards

3. **Approve**: Present evaluation table with options (MANDATORY in default mode)
   - `[a]` Approve all recommended fixes
   - `[s]` Select specific issues to fix
   - `[v]` View detailed analysis for a comment
   - `[n]` Skip all fixes

4. **Fix**: Apply approved fixes (delegate as needed)

5. **Notify**: Post `@coderabbitai resolve` to PR, push changes

### Local Mode (`--local`)

1. **Run**: Execute CodeRabbit CLI with local config

   ```bash
   coderabbit review --prompt-only --type all --config .coderabbit.yaml
   ```

   - `--type all`: Reviews both uncommitted and committed changes
   - `--config .coderabbit.yaml`: Uses repository-specific settings

2. **Evaluate**: Same as PR mode - analyze against project standards

3. **Approve**: Same interactive table with additional option
   - `[a]` Approve all recommended fixes
   - `[s]` Select specific issues to fix
   - `[v]` View detailed analysis
   - `[n]` Skip all - document as ignored for PR
   - `[c]` Continue without action (no tracking)

4. **Track Ignored Issues**: For skipped issues, prompt for reason:
   - `nitpick` - Style preference, not a real issue
   - `false-positive` - CodeRabbit misunderstood the code
   - `intentional` - Deliberate design choice
   - `out-of-scope` - Valid but not for this PR
   - `will-fix-later` - Acknowledged, tracked elsewhere

   Store in `.tmp/coderabbit-ignored.json` for PR acknowledgment

5. **Fix**: Apply approved fixes (same as PR mode, no PR posting)

    }
  ]
}
```

## Implementation Notes

**CRITICAL**: In default mode (no `--auto`), you MUST use the `AskUserQuestion` tool after
displaying the evaluation table. Present the options and WAIT for user response before
applying any fixes. Never proceed without explicit approval.

**Multi-Source Fetching**: Query all 3 GitHub API endpoints to ensure comprehensive
coverage. Filter for CodeRabbit-authored comments. Merge and deduplicate by comment ID.

## Notes

### PR Mode

- Fetches fresh data each run (no caching)
- Can run multiple times safely (idempotent)
- Posts resolution comment to trigger CodeRabbit update
- Typical execution: 2-5 minutes

### Local Mode

- Runs CodeRabbit CLI locally (requires `coderabbit` installed and authenticated)
- Uses `.coderabbit.yaml` for path instructions and tool configuration
- Stores ignored issues in `.tmp/coderabbit-ignored.json`
- Ignored issues file is consumed by `/ship-it` when creating PR
- Does NOT post to GitHub (no PR exists yet)
- Typical execution: 1-3 minutes
