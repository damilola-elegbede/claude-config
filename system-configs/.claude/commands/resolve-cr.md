# /resolve-cr Command

## Description

Automatically fetches and resolves ALL CodeRabbit AI review comments from the PR associated with the current
branch. Focuses on every "Prompts for AI Agents" section containing actionable code improvement suggestions.

## Usage

```bash
/resolve-cr [pr-number]
```yaml

## Arguments

- `pr-number` (optional): Specific PR number to resolve comments from. If not provided, uses the current branch's PR.

## Behavior

When you invoke `/resolve-cr`, I will:

1. **Identify repository and target PR** from current branch or provided number
2. **Exhaustively search** for ALL CodeRabbit review comments
3. **Extract improvement suggestions** from "Prompts for AI Agents" sections
4. **Verify comment authenticity** with user confirmation
5. **Deploy specialized agents** to implement fixes
6. **Apply all changes** in organized commits
7. **Push changes** to the remote repository
8. **Post comprehensive PR comment** with "@coderabbitai resolve" and detailed summary of all fixes applied
9. **Report completion** with summary of resolutions
10. **Deploy execution-evaluator** to verify:
    - All CodeRabbit comments found and processed
    - Fixes correctly implemented
    - No code broken by changes
    - Commits created with proper messages
    - Changes pushed successfully
    - PR comment posted with full details

## Search Strategy

### Repository Identification

Before searching for comments, I must establish proper repository context:

1. **Extract repository owner/name** from git remote or current directory
2. **Verify repository exists** via GitHub API
3. **Confirm PR exists** and belongs to the identified repository
4. **Handle common issues**:
   - Fork vs upstream repository confusion
   - Private repository access requirements
   - Cross-organization PR references

### Comprehensive Comment Discovery

I search for CodeRabbit comments using multiple methods in prioritized order:

#### Primary Search Endpoints (Sequential Execution)

- `/pulls/{pr}/comments` - **Start here** - Inline review comments (most common location)
- `/pulls/{pr}/reviews` - Review-level comments
- `/issues/{pr}/comments` - Conversation comments (backup location)

#### Search Patterns

- Primary: `coderabbitai[bot]` user comments
- Secondary: `@coderabbitai` mentions in comment body
- Tertiary: `Prompts for AI Agents` section headers

#### Comment Verification Process

I verify found comments with the user:

1. **Display comment preview** with author, timestamp, and file location
2. **Show "Prompts for AI Agents" sections** found in each comment
3. **Request user confirmation** before proceeding with fixes
4. **Allow selective processing** if user wants to skip certain comments

#### Search Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

- **Empty results**: Check different endpoints, verify repository access
- **JSON parsing errors**: Handle Unicode control characters with error recovery
- **Rate limits**: Use exponential backoff with retry-after headers
- **Pagination**: Always check for `next` links and process all pages
- **Authentication**: Ensure GitHub token has proper repository access

### Comment Types Processed

I process ALL comment types:

- **Inline code comments** on specific lines
- **File-level comments** on entire files
- **Review summary comments** at PR level
- **Discussion thread comments** in conversations
- **Nested reply comments** in threads

## Resolution Process

### Phase 1: Discovery and Analysis

I gather all CodeRabbit feedback:

1. **Fetch all comments** from all sources
2. **Extract actionable items** from "Prompts for AI Agents" sections
3. **Categorize by type**:
   - Security vulnerabilities
   - Performance optimizations
   - Code quality improvements
   - Missing tests
   - Documentation needs
   - Bug fixes
   - Style/formatting issues

### Phase 2: Agent Deployment

I deploy appropriate specialists based on issue type:

| Issue Type | Primary Agent | Supporting Agents |
|------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Security vulnerabilities | security-auditor | backend-engineer |
| Performance issues | performance-specialist | monitoring-specialist |
| Missing tests | test-engineer | code-reviewer |
| Code quality | code-reviewer | backend-engineer |
| Documentation | tech-writer | - |
| UI/UX issues | frontend-architect | ui-designer |
| API problems | api-architect | backend-engineer |
| Type errors | backend-engineer | - |

### Phase 3: Implementation

I apply fixes systematically:

1. **Group related changes** by file and type
2. **Apply fixes in logical order**:
   - Security fixes first
   - Breaking changes next
   - Quality improvements
   - Documentation updates last
3. **Use batch operations** for efficiency:
   - MultiEdit for multiple changes in same file
   - Parallel processing for independent files
4. **Validate each change**:
   - Ensure tests still pass
   - Verify no new issues introduced

### Phase 4: Commit Organization and Push

I create organized commits:

```text
fix: address CodeRabbit security findings
- Fix SQL injection vulnerability in user query
- Add input validation for API endpoints
- Escape HTML in template rendering

refactor: improve code quality per CodeRabbit review
- Extract complex logic into separate functions
- Add type hints to all public methods
- Reduce cyclomatic complexity in auth module

test: add missing test coverage identified by CodeRabbit
- Add unit tests for error handling paths
- Add integration tests for new endpoints
- Increase coverage to meet 80% threshold

docs: update documentation per CodeRabbit suggestions
- Add API endpoint documentation
- Update README with new features
- Add inline comments for complex logic
```

Then push all commits to the remote repository:

```bash
git push origin {current-branch}
```

### Phase 5: PR Notification

After successfully pushing all changes, I post a comprehensive comment on the PR:

```bash
gh pr comment {pr-number} --body "@coderabbitai resolve

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Critical Error Resolution

| Issue | Root Cause | Solution |
|-------|------------|----------|
| **404 Not Found** | Wrong repository identified | Verify git remote, check repository access, confirm PR number |
| **Empty comment results** | Searching wrong endpoint | Try `/pulls/{pr}/comments` first, then `/pulls/{pr}/reviews` |
| **JSON parsing failure** | Unicode control characters | Use error recovery, strip invalid characters, request raw |
| **Rate limit exceeded** | Too many API calls | Implement exponential backoff, use authenticated requests |
| **No "Prompts for AI Agents"** | CodeRabbit didn't generate suggestions | Verify CodeRabbit ran, check if PR has code |

### Verification Steps

Before processing comments:

1. **Confirm repository context**: Display "owner/repo" for user verification
2. **Show PR details**: Title, number, status, and branch information
3. **Preview found comments**: Author, timestamp, file location, and content snippet
4. **Validate suggestions**: Ensure "Prompts for AI Agents" sections contain actionable items

### Recovery Procedures

When searches fail:

1. **Try alternative endpoints** in sequence
2. **Check authentication** and repository access
3. **Verify PR exists** and is accessible
4. **Request manual comment URL** as fallback
5. **Offer to process specific files** if bulk search fails

## Best Practices

### Pre-Execution Checklist

1. **Verify repository context** before starting search
2. **Run tests first** to ensure clean baseline
3. **Check git status** for uncommitted changes
4. **Confirm PR is current** and contains recent CodeRabbit reviews

### During Execution

1. **Always show found comments** for user verification
2. **Process comments in priority order** (security first)
3. **Group related fixes** in logical commits
4. **Validate each change** against original suggestion
5. **Push changes** before posting PR comment

### Post-Execution

1. **Review applied changes** before committing
2. **Run tests after each commit** to catch regressions
3. **Document resolution reasoning** in commit messages
4. **Push all commits** to remote repository
5. **Post comprehensive PR comment** with detailed resolution summary
6. **Check CI status** after pushing changes
7. **Verify CodeRabbit marks items as resolved** (if applicable)

## Important Notes

### Critical Success Factors

- **Repository identification is essential** - 404 errors are usually caused by wrong repository context
- **Start with `/pulls/{pr}/comments` endpoint** - this contains most CodeRabbit inline comments
- **Always verify comments with user** - prevents processing wrong or outdated suggestions
- **Push changes before posting PR comment** - ensures all fixes are complete and available
- **Post comprehensive PR comment only after successful push** - provides detailed summary of all applied changes
- **Handle JSON parsing gracefully** - Unicode control characters can break parsing

### Processing Guidelines

- The command processes ALL comments found, not just unresolved ones
- Some suggestions may require human judgment and are flagged for manual review
- Complex architectural changes are identified but not automatically applied
- The command respects existing code style and conventions
- User confirmation is required before applying any changes

### Fallback Strategies

- If automated search fails, request direct comment URLs from user
- If repository access fails, verify authentication and permissions
- If no "Prompts for AI Agents" found, check if CodeRabbit ran successfully
- If JSON parsing fails, request raw comment content and process manually
