# ShellCheck configuration file
# See: https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/blob/master/shellcheck.1.md#rc-files

# Default shell (can be overridden with -s)
shell=bash

# Severity level: error, warning, info, style
severity=warning

# Exclude specific checks that are commonly problematic in this codebase
# SC1091: Not following sourced files (common in CI scripts)
# SC2034: Variable appears unused (common in scripts with exports)
# SC2155: Declare and assign separately (acceptable pattern in this codebase)
# SC2250: Prefer putting braces around variable references (style preference)
# SC2292: Prefer [[ ]] over [ ] for tests (style preference)  
# SC2310: This function is invoked in condition (common pattern)
# SC2086: Double quote variables (acceptable in controlled contexts)
# SC2312: Command substitution masking (info-level, not critical)
# SC2249: Default case in switch statements (optional style preference)
#
# Note: SC2164 (cd failures) and SC2154 (undefined variables) are kept as warnings
# as they indicate real issues that should be addressed
exclude=SC1091,SC2034,SC2155,SC2250,SC2292,SC2310,SC2086,SC2312,SC2249

# Enable all optional checks
enable=all

# Format for output (gcc, checkstyle, diff, json, json1, quiet, tty)
format=gcc

# Additional excludes for specific patterns that are acceptable in this project:
# SC2012: Use find instead of ls - acceptable for simple cases
# SC2164: Use cd ... || exit in case cd fails - not always necessary in controlled environments
# SC2002: Useless cat - sometimes used for readability

# Note: Individual scripts can override these settings with:
# shellcheck disable=SC2086
# at the top of the file or specific lines
