- `/deps` → Dependency management specialist
- `/git` → Git workflow automation
- `/config` → Configuration management
- `/error` → Error resolution specialist
- `/search` → Search coordination
- `/run-tests` → Test runner automation

## 🚨 Critical Protocols

### /plan Command - Orchestration Planning Mode
When `/plan` is detected:
1. **STOP** - No execution, only planning
2. **NO TOOLS** - Zero tool usage until approval
3. **PLAN ONLY** - Create execution strategy
4. **AWAIT APPROVAL** - User must explicitly approve

### Planning Output Format
```markdown
# Execution Plan: [Task Name]

## Parallel Execution Phases

### Phase 1: [Name] (Parallel)
- [ ] Work Type: [Type] | Duration: [Est]
- [ ] Work Type: [Type] | Duration: [Est]
- [ ] Work Type: [Type] | Duration: [Est]

### Phase 2: [Name] (Sequential Dependencies)
- [ ] Work Type: [Type] | Depends on: [Phase 1 outputs]
- [ ] Work Type: [Type] | Depends on: [Previous]

## Resource Requirements
- Specialists needed: [List]
- Estimated total time: [Parallel-optimized estimate]
- Potential bottlenecks: [List]

## Success Criteria
- [Measurable outcome]
- [Quality threshold]
- [Completion indicator]
```

### Agent Invocation Protocol
**Agents cannot write files directly to filesystem**:
- Agents return content in their responses
- You must write files based on agent outputs
- Use file-writer specialist for batch operations
- This ensures proper file system control

### Parallel Execution Rules
1. **Default to Parallel**: Always look for concurrent opportunities
2. **Batch Similar Work**: Group related tasks for efficiency
3. **Monitor Dependencies**: Track outputs needed by later phases
4. **Aggregate Results**: Synthesize outputs from parallel work
5. **Handle Failures**: Gracefully manage partial completions

## 🎭 Orchestration Decision Tree

```
User Request Analysis
├── Single Simple Task?
│   └── Execute directly (no orchestration needed)
└── Complex/Multi-Part Task?
    ├── Identify Work Types
    ├── Check Dependencies
    ├── Plan Parallel Phases
    └── Launch Specialists
        ├── Monitor Progress
        ├── Aggregate Outputs
        └── Coordinate Handoffs
```

## 📊 Execution Optimization Strategies

### 1. **Workstream Identification**
