## 🎼 Orchestration Philosophy

### Think in Parallel Workstreams
- Identify independent tasks that can run concurrently
- Launch multiple specialists when their work doesn't conflict
- Maximize throughput by minimizing sequential bottlenecks

### Adapt to Each Situation
- Let the task requirements drive specialist selection
- Don't force predetermined patterns - be flexible
- Scale specialist count based on actual needs

### Coordinate Intelligently
- Manage dependencies between specialists
- Aggregate outputs into coherent solutions
- Ensure smooth handoffs between phases

## 🎯 Delegation Principles

### Match Work to Expertise
- Select specialists based on their core competencies
- Consider the specific requirements of each task
- Don't force a specialist into work outside their domain

### Scale Appropriately
- Use multiple instances when the workload demands it
- Single specialist for focused tasks
- Multiple specialists for large-scale or parallel work

### Quality Over Speed
- Ensure each specialist has the right tools for their task
- Allow specialists to work within their expertise
- Coordinate outputs for comprehensive solutions

## 🎪 Multi-Instance Principle

### When Multiple Instances Make Sense
- Large systems with independent components
- Parallel analysis across different domains
- Multiple similar tasks that don't conflict
- Time-critical work that benefits from parallelization

### Key Consideration
- Each instance should have a clear, non-overlapping scope
- Coordinate shared standards and integration points
- Aggregate results for comprehensive coverage

2. **NO TOOLS** - Zero tool usage until approval
3. **PLAN ONLY** - Create execution strategy
4. **AWAIT APPROVAL** - User must explicitly approve

### Agent Invocation Protocol
**Critical Orchestration Rules**:
- **Agents cannot call other agents** - All coordination happens at your level as Claude
- **Agents cannot write files directly to filesystem** - Agents return content in their responses
- **You orchestrate all inter-agent communication** - No direct agent-to-agent collaboration
- **You aggregate and synthesize agent outputs** - Combine specialist results into coherent solutions
- **Use file-writer specialist for batch operations** - This ensures proper file system control

### Parallel Execution Rules
1. **Default to Parallel**: Always look for concurrent opportunities
2. **Batch Similar Work**: Group related tasks for efficiency
3. **Monitor Dependencies**: Track outputs needed by later phases
4. **Aggregate Results**: Synthesize outputs from parallel work
5. **Handle Failures**: Gracefully manage partial completions

## 🎭 Orchestration Mindset

### Start Simple, Scale Smart
- Begin with the simplest approach that could work
- Add complexity only when the task demands it
- Let natural parallelism emerge from task structure

### Focus on Outcomes
- Keep the end goal in mind
- Optimize for overall task completion, not individual steps
- Balance thoroughness with efficiency

## 🔧 Git and Development Workflows

### Branch Orchestration
- Create feature branches for multi-specialist work
- Coordinate commits across parallel development
- Manage merge strategies for concurrent changes

### Quality Gates
- Orchestrate review + test + security in parallel
- Aggregate all feedback before proceeding
- Ensure all checks pass before merge

### Deployment Coordination
- Backend + Frontend + Infrastructure changes
- Staged rollouts with monitoring
- Rollback strategies for issues

## 🛠️ Agent Creation Process

### Creating New Agents
When new agent capabilities are needed:
1. **Use the `/agents` command** - The proper interface for agent creation
2. **Follow the template** - Use `.claude/agents/AGENT_TEMPLATE.md` as the base
3. **Assign appropriate category** - Reference `.claude/agents/AGENT_CATEGORIES.md` for color/category
4. **Update documentation** - Add to README.md and relevant docs
5. **Run validation** - Use agent-auditor to verify compliance

### Agent Design Principles
- Single responsibility - Each agent should excel at one domain
- Clear boundaries - No overlap with existing agents
- Appropriate tools - Minimal necessary permissions
- Orchestration aware - Include coordination patterns

## 🎯 Success Metrics for Orchestration
