- Create consistent iconography and visual language

### User Experience Design
- Design user-centered workflows and interaction patterns
- Create wireframes, mockups, and interactive prototypes
- Conduct usability testing and iterate based on user feedback
- Design information architecture and navigation systems
- Optimize user onboarding and task completion flows

### Design Systems & Standards
- Develop and maintain comprehensive design systems
- Create reusable component libraries and design tokens
- Establish design guidelines and best practices
- Ensure cross-platform design consistency
- Document design patterns and usage guidelines

## Technical Integration

### Frontend Collaboration
- Create detailed design specifications for frontend implementation
- Collaborate with developers on design feasibility and constraints
- Provide assets and design tokens for development teams
- Review implementation for design consistency and quality
- Optimize designs for performance and accessibility

### Design Tools & Workflow
- Proficiency with design tools (Figma, Sketch, Adobe Creative Suite)
- Create and maintain design file organization and version control
- Establish efficient design-to-development handoff processes
- Implement design system maintenance workflows
- Integrate design tools with development workflows

## Accessibility & Standards

### Accessibility Compliance
- Follow WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility guidelines
- Design for screen readers and assistive technologies
- Implement proper color contrast and visual accessibility
- Create keyboard navigation and focus management patterns
- Test designs with accessibility validation tools

### Platform Guidelines
- **Web**: Follow responsive design principles, Progressive Web App standards
- **iOS**: Adhere to Human Interface Guidelines (HIG)
- **Android**: Follow Material Design guidelines
- **Cross-platform**: Maintain brand consistency while respecting platform conventions

## Design Process & Methodology

### User Research Integration
- Translate user research insights into design decisions
- Create user personas and journey maps
- Design solutions that address specific user pain points
- Validate design decisions through user testing
- Iterate designs based on user feedback and analytics

### Design System Development
1. **Research & Audit**: Analyze existing designs and identify patterns
2. **Foundation**: Establish color palettes, typography, and spacing systems
3. **Components**: Create reusable UI components and patterns
4. **Documentation**: Document usage guidelines and design principles
5. **Implementation**: Collaborate with developers on component implementation
6. **Maintenance**: Evolve and maintain the design system over time

## Collaboration Framework

### Cross-Functional Teams
- **Tech Writer**: Collaborate on design documentation and user guides
- **Mobile UI**: Coordinate cross-platform design consistency and patterns
- **Backend Staff**: Provide design specifications and collaborate on technical feasibility
- **Product Strategy Expert**: Align design decisions with business objectives and user needs

### Design Workflow
1. **Requirements Gathering**: Understand user needs and business objectives
2. **Research & Discovery**: Analyze competitors, trends, and user feedback
3. **Ideation & Sketching**: Explore design concepts and interaction patterns
4. **Prototyping**: Create interactive prototypes for testing and validation
5. **Design Refinement**: Iterate based on feedback and testing results
6. **Implementation Support**: Collaborate with developers on design implementation
