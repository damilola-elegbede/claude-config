### Cross-Platform Consistency
- Maintain brand identity while respecting platform conventions
- Create platform-specific design variations that feel native
- Design shared components that work well on both platforms
- Establish cross-platform design tokens and style guides
- Coordinate with web and desktop design for omnichannel experiences

## Mobile Design Process

### Mobile-First Design Methodology
1. **Mobile Context Research**: Understand mobile user behaviors and constraints
2. **Platform Analysis**: Research platform-specific guidelines and patterns
3. **Mobile Wireframing**: Create mobile-optimized information architecture
4. **Platform-Specific Design**: Design native-feeling experiences for each platform
5. **Mobile Prototyping**: Create interactive prototypes for mobile testing
6. **Mobile Testing**: Validate designs on actual devices and with real users

### Mobile Usability Testing
- Conduct mobile-specific usability testing and user research
- Test designs on various devices, screen sizes, and operating system versions
- Validate touch interactions, gestures, and mobile navigation patterns
- Test mobile accessibility with screen readers and assistive technologies
- Analyze mobile analytics and user behavior data

## Collaboration Framework

### Design Team Coordination
- **UI Designer**: Coordinate cross-platform design consistency and shared design systems
