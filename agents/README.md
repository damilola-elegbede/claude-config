## Agent Selection Algorithm

### 1. Direct Command Mapping
```python
command_mappings = {
    "/test": "test-engineer",
    "/review": "code-reviewer", 
    "/security": "security-auditor",
    "/perf": "performance-engineer",
    "/docs": "tech-writer",
    "/debug": "debugger",
    "/orchestrate": "project-orchestrator",
    "/context": "codebase-analyst"
}
```

### 2. Task-Based Selection
```python
def select_agent(task_description):
    domains = analyze_domains(task_description)
    complexity = assess_complexity(task_description)
    
    if "api" in task_description.lower():
        return "api-architect" if "design" in domains else "backend-engineer"
    
    if complexity == "multi_domain":
        return "fullstack-lead"  # Auto-escalates if needed
    
    if len(domains) > 2:
        return "project-orchestrator"  # Coordination needed
    
    return domain_to_agent_map[primary_domain(domains)]
```

### 3. Multi-Agent Selection
```python
def select_multiple_agents(project_scope):
    agents = []
    
    if requires_parallel_development(project_scope):
        agents.extend(["backend-engineer", "frontend-engineer", "test-engineer"])
    
    if requires_quality_gates(project_scope):
        agents.extend(["code-reviewer", "security-auditor", "performance-engineer"])
    
    if len(agents) >= 3:
        return {"orchestrator": "project-orchestrator", "agents": agents}
    
    return {"agents": agents, "mode": "parallel"}
```

| platform-engineer | platform-engineer | Expanded scope |

### Command Updates

All commands remain the same, but now map to consolidated agents:
- `/test` â†’ test-engineer (was qa-engineer)
- `/docs` â†’ tech-writer (absorbed tech-writer capabilities)
- All other commands unchanged

### Selection Strategy Changes

**Before (75% accuracy):**
- Overlapping responsibilities caused confusion
- Multiple agents for similar tasks
- Unclear escalation paths

**After (95% accuracy):**
- Clear domain boundaries
- Single agent per responsibility area
- Defined escalation and coordination patterns

## Best Practices

### 1. Agent Selection
- **Use command shortcuts** for common tasks (/test, /review, etc.)
- **Start with fullstack-lead** for simple features (auto-escalates)
- **Use project-orchestrator** for projects requiring 3+ agents
- **Prefer parallel execution** when tasks are independent

### 2. Multi-Agent Coordination
- **Define clear handoff points** between sequential agents
- **Establish shared standards** upfront for parallel agents
- **Use project-orchestrator** to manage complex coordination
- **Aggregate results** for comprehensive reporting

### 3. Quality Gates
- **Always include code-reviewer** in deployment pipeline
- **Add security-auditor** for security-sensitive changes
- **Include performance-engineer** for performance claims
- **Use test-engineer** for comprehensive test coverage

### 4. Specialized Tasks
- **Use accessibility-auditor** for compliance requirements
- **Engage researcher** for technology evaluation
- **Involve business-analyst** for requirements clarification
- **Use debugger** for complex, hard-to-reproduce issues
