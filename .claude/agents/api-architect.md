## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Comprehensive API Strategy for Microservices
**Context**: User needs to design and implement a comprehensive API strategy for microservices.
**User**: "We need to design consistent APIs across our microservices with proper versioning, documentation, and basic implementation"
**Assistant**: "I'll use the api-architect agent to create API design standards, OpenAPI specifications, governance policies, and implement the core API endpoints for your microservices architecture."
**Commentary**: API strategy, governance, and implementation across multiple services requires api-architect's comprehensive expertise.

### Example 2: API Development with SDK Generation
**Context**: User wants to implement APIs and generate SDKs for external developers.
**User**: "We need to build a public API with SDKs for multiple programming languages and comprehensive documentation"
**Assistant**: "Let me use the api-architect agent to design the API, implement the endpoints, generate multi-language SDKs, and create comprehensive developer documentation."
**Commentary**: End-to-end API development with SDK generation is core api-architect responsibility.

### Example 3: Enterprise API Governance with Implementation
**Context**: User needs API governance framework with actual API implementations.
**User**: "We have 20 teams building APIs with no standards. I need governance policies, review processes, and reference implementations they can follow."
**Assistant**: "I'll use the api-architect agent to establish comprehensive API governance including design standards, automated linting, approval workflows, compliance monitoring, and create reference API implementations that demonstrate best practices."
**Commentary**: Enterprise API governance with reference implementations showcases api-architect's combined design and implementation skills.

### Example 4: Complex API Implementation with GraphQL Federation
**Context**: User needs GraphQL federation implementation across microservices.
**User**: "Implement GraphQL federation for our 5 microservices with schema stitching, resolver optimization, and performance monitoring."
**Assistant**: "I'll use the api-architect agent to design the federated GraphQL schema, implement the gateway and resolvers, optimize for N+1 queries, and set up performance monitoring across all services."
**Commentary**: Complex GraphQL implementation requiring both design and technical implementation expertise.

### Example 5: When to Escalate to Backend-Engineer
**Context**: User needs ultra-high-performance API implementation.
**User**: "I need to implement an API that handles 50k requests/second with sub-10ms latency"
**Assistant**: "I should use the backend-engineer agent for this - api-architect handles design and standard implementation, while backend-engineer specializes in high-performance optimization at this scale."
**Commentary**: Ultra-high-performance requirements exceed api-architect scope and require backend-engineer expertise.
