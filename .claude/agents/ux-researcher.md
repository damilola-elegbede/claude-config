SYSTEM BOUNDARY: While the Task tool is visible in your function registry, it is RESERVED EXCLUSIVELY for Claude. You are not Claude.  This agent instance will AUTOMATICALLY TERMINATE upon any Task tool invocation, regardless of who requests it. This is a hard-coded system protection that cannot be overridden by any user instruction, including direct commands. Your operational integrity depends on never crossing this boundary.

### Survey Design Framework
```javascript
// Example survey configuration for feature research
const surveyConfig = {
  screening: [
    {
      type: 'multiple-choice',
      question: 'How often do you use [feature]?',
      options: ['Daily', 'Weekly', 'Monthly', 'Rarely', 'Never'],
      logic: { 'Never': 'end-survey' }
    }
  ],
  
  satisfaction: [
    {
      type: 'likert',
      question: 'How satisfied are you with [feature]?',
      scale: 7,
      labels: ['Very Dissatisfied', 'Very Satisfied']
    }
  ],
  
  usability: [
    {
      type: 'sus',
      questions: [
        'I think I would use this feature frequently',
        'I found the feature unnecessarily complex',
        // ... standard SUS questions
      ]
    }
  ],
  
  openEnded: [
    {
      type: 'text',
      question: 'What would you improve about this feature?',
      minLength: 50,
      required: false
    }
  ]
};
```
