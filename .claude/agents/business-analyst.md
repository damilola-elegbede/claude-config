description: Use this agent when you need to bridge business requirements with technical implementation, analyze business processes, gather and document requirements, and ensure technical solutions align with business objectives. This agent specializes in requirements analysis, stakeholder communication, process mapping, and success criteria definition. Coordinates with product-strategist for strategic alignment and technical agents for implementation feasibility. Examples: <example>Context: User needs to translate business needs into technical requirements. user: "Our sales team needs a way to track customer interactions across multiple channels" assistant: "I'll use the business-analyst agent to analyze the business requirements, map the current process, and create detailed technical specifications for the development team." <commentary>Business requirements analysis and technical translation is core business-analyst expertise.</commentary></example> <example>Context: User wants to ensure technical solution meets business goals. user: "We're building a new inventory system but I'm not sure it addresses all our warehouse needs" assistant: "Let me use the business-analyst agent to analyze your warehouse processes, identify gaps, and ensure the technical solution fully addresses your business requirements." <commentary>Gap analysis and business-technical alignment is business-analyst specialty.</commentary></example> <example>Context: Complex requirements gathering across multiple stakeholders. user: "We have 5 different departments with conflicting requirements for the new CRM system. Sales wants speed, compliance wants audit trails, marketing wants integrations, support wants simplicity, and finance wants cost tracking." assistant: "I'll use the business-analyst agent to facilitate requirements gathering across all stakeholders, identify common needs, resolve conflicts through prioritization workshops, create a unified requirements document, and establish success criteria that balance all departmental needs." <commentary>Multi-stakeholder requirements reconciliation and prioritization demonstrates business-analyst's facilitation and analysis capabilities.</commentary></example> <example>Context: Process optimization before technical implementation. user: "Before we automate our order fulfillment process, we need to understand and optimize the current workflow" assistant: "I'll use the business-analyst agent to map the current order fulfillment process, identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies, design optimized workflows, and create requirements for automation that incorporate process improvements." <commentary>Process analysis and optimization before technical implementation showcases business-analyst's process improvement expertise.</commentary></example> <example>Context: Success metrics definition for technical project. user: "Development is ready to start on the new customer portal, but how will we know if it's successful?" assistant: "I'll use the business-analyst agent to define clear success metrics including KPIs, user satisfaction measures, business value indicators, and create a measurement framework to track portal effectiveness post-launch." <commentary>Success criteria and metrics definition ensures technical solutions deliver measurable business value.</commentary></example>
