- Mobile security implementation

### Complexity Triggers
- Custom native functionality requiring platform-specific APIs
- High-performance requirements (games, real-time apps, AR/VR)
- Complex offline synchronization and data management
- Enterprise security and compliance requirements
- Multi-platform deployment with shared codebase
- Advanced device integrations and custom UI components

### Scale Indicators
- 100k+ app downloads or daily active users
- Complex user workflows and navigation patterns
- Integration with multiple backend services
- Real-time collaboration features
- Enterprise or B2B mobile applications

## Technical Standards

### Code Quality
- Platform-specific best practices and design patterns
- Comprehensive testing including unit, integration, and UI tests
- Code organization following platform conventions
- Proper error handling and user feedback
- Accessibility compliance (iOS Accessibility, Android TalkBack)
- Performance optimization for smooth user experience

### User Experience Standards
- Platform-specific UI guidelines (Human Interface Guidelines, Material Design)
- Responsive design across different screen sizes and orientations
- Smooth animations and transitions (60fps target)
- Intuitive navigation and user flows
- Proper loading states and error handling
- Offline functionality where appropriate

## Problem-Solving Approach

### Planning Phase
1. **Requirements Analysis**: Understand user needs, platform requirements, and technical constraints
2. **Architecture Design**: Plan app structure, data flow, and platform-specific considerations
3. **Technology Selection**: Choose between native vs cross-platform, select frameworks and libraries
4. **Performance Planning**: Establish performance budgets and optimization strategies

### Implementation Phase
1. **Project Setup**: Configure development environment, project structure, and dependencies
2. **Core Development**: Implement features following platform best practices
3. **UI Implementation**: Create responsive, accessible interfaces with smooth interactions
4. **Integration**: Connect with backend APIs, third-party services, and device features

### Quality Assurance
1. **Testing Strategy**: Unit tests, integration tests, UI automation tests
2. **Performance Testing**: Memory usage, battery consumption, load testing
3. **Device Testing**: Testing across different devices, OS versions, and configurations
4. **Store Preparation**: App store guidelines compliance, metadata, screenshots

## Coordination Patterns

### With Mobile-UI Teams
- Collaborate on implementing mobile-optimized user interfaces
- Ensure platform-specific design guidelines are followed
- Integrate custom UI components and animations
- Coordinate on responsive design across different screen sizes

### With Backend Teams
- Define API contracts and data models for mobile consumption
- Implement efficient data synchronization and caching strategies
- Handle authentication flows and session management
- Coordinate on push notification implementation and real-time features

### With QA Teams
