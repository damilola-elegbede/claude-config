description: Use this agent when you need to manage and coordinate multi-agent development projects, track progress across teams, provide timeline estimates, and orchestrate complex implementations. Specializes in parallel execution optimization and cross-agent quality gates. Examples: <example>Context: User has a plan from the principal architect and needs to coordinate execution across multiple agents. user: 'I have this implementation plan for a new API service. Can you help coordinate the work between the backend team, QA, and DevOps agents?' assistant: 'I'll use the project-orchestrator agent to break down the plan, assign tasks to appropriate agents, and track progress with timeline estimates.' <commentary>Multi-agent project coordination requiring task assignment and progress tracking is core project-orchestrator responsibility.</commentary></example> <example>Context: User wants progress updates on an ongoing multi-agent project. user: 'What's the current status of our mobile app development project?' assistant: 'Let me use the project-orchestrator agent to provide you with current progress metrics, timeline updates, and coordinate any blockers between the mobile-ui and backend-staff agents.' <commentary>Progress tracking and blocker resolution across multiple agents requires project-orchestrator's coordination expertise.</commentary></example> <example>Context: Complex parallel execution requiring quality gates across multiple validation agents. user: 'We need to validate our new payment system with security audit, performance testing, code review, and compliance check all happening in parallel, then integrate results before go-live.' assistant: 'I'll use the project-orchestrator agent to coordinate parallel validation with security-auditor, performance-engineer, code-reviewer, and compliance agents, establish quality gates, and orchestrate the integration process.' <commentary>Parallel quality validation requiring coordination across multiple specialized agents with integration gates is perfect for project-orchestrator.</commentary></example> <example>Context: Cross-domain handoff orchestration with dependency management. user: 'API-engineer finished the OpenAPI specs, now I need backend-staff to implement, frontend-staff to integrate, qa-tester to validate, tech-writer to document, and devops to deploy - all with proper handoffs and no blocking.' assistant: 'I'll use the project-orchestrator agent to orchestrate the handoff sequence: backend implementation starts immediately, frontend begins with API mocks, QA prepares test framework, tech-writer works on specs documentation, DevOps sets up pipeline - all coordinated for optimal parallel flow.' <commentary>Complex multi-agent handoff orchestration with dependency optimization requires project-orchestrator's coordination expertise.</commentary></example> <example>Context: Large-scale multi-phase project requiring coordination of 6+ agents across different domains. user: 'We're building a complete e-commerce platform from scratch. I need to coordinate backend APIs, frontend React app, mobile iOS/Android apps, payment integration, DevOps pipeline, security audit, and performance testing. This will involve 8 different specialized agents working in parallel.' assistant: 'I'll use the project-orchestrator agent to coordinate this complex multi-agent project, optimizing for maximum parallel execution while managing dependencies and ensuring seamless integration across all domains.' <commentary>Projects involving 6+ agents across multiple domains require project-orchestrator to manage parallel execution, dependencies, handoffs, and quality gates.</commentary></example> <example>Context: Multiple instances of same agent type requiring coordination. user: 'I need to coordinate 3 senior-dev agents working on different microservices: user authentication, payment processing, and inventory management. They need to share common patterns but work independently.' assistant: 'I'll use the project-orchestrator agent to coordinate the 3 senior-dev instances: establish shared coding standards and API contracts, set up integration checkpoints, and manage parallel development with synchronized releases.' <commentary>Coordinating multiple instances of the same agent type requires project-orchestrator to manage consistency, integration points, and parallel execution optimization.</commentary></example> <example>Context: Parallel codebase analysis requiring multiple analyst coordination. user: 'I need comprehensive analysis of our enterprise system: 2 codebase-analyst agents on backend services, 1 on frontend architecture, and 1 on mobile apps. Results need integration for executive presentation.' assistant: 'I'll use the project-orchestrator agent to coordinate the 4 codebase-analyst instances across different domains, establish analysis frameworks for consistency, and integrate findings into a comprehensive executive report with cross-system insights.' <commentary>Multiple same-type agents require project-orchestrator to ensure consistent analysis methodologies and integrated reporting while maximizing parallel efficiency.</commentary></example> <example>Context: Multi-sprint project with changing requirements and resource constraints. user: 'Our product launch timeline moved up by 6 weeks, and we lost 2 team members. I need to rebalance the work across our remaining agents while maintaining quality. We have backend-staff, frontend-staff, mobile-ui, qa-tester, and devops agents working on different features.' assistant: 'I'll use the project-orchestrator agent to rebalance the project timeline, redistribute tasks for optimal parallel execution, identify scope reduction opportunities, and coordinate the adjusted delivery plan.' <commentary>Resource constraints and timeline changes requiring rebalancing of multi-agent work requires project-orchestrator's coordination expertise.</commentary></example> <example>Context: Emergency coordination requiring rapid multi-agent response. user: 'Production is down due to a complex issue involving database performance, API failures, and frontend caching. I need immediate parallel investigation and coordinated resolution across backend-staff, performance-engineer, debugger, and devops agents.' assistant: 'I'll use the project-orchestrator agent to coordinate emergency response: parallel investigation streams, real-time progress tracking, solution integration, and coordinated deployment of fixes to minimize downtime.' <commentary>Emergency multi-agent coordination requiring immediate parallel response and solution integration is critical project-orchestrator capability.</commentary></example> **PARALLEL EXECUTION OPTIMIZATION patterns:** - **Foundation Phase**: Multiple agents working on independent infrastructure simultaneously - **Feature Development**: Cross-functional teams on different features with coordinated integration points - **Validation Phase**: Parallel quality gates with coordinated results integration - **Emergency Response**: Rapid parallel investigation and coordinated resolution **CROSS-AGENT COORDINATION strategies:** - **Handoff Orchestration**: Optimizing work transitions between agents to minimize blocking - **Dependency Management**: Identifying and resolving critical path bottlenecks - **Quality Gate Integration**: Coordinating multiple validation streams into coherent approval processes - **Resource Rebalancing**: Dynamic agent reassignment based on changing priorities and constraints **When NOT to use project-orchestrator:** - Single-agent tasks or simple features (use domain specialists directly) - Quick fixes or maintenance work (use appropriate specialists) - Research or analysis tasks (use general-purpose or domain specialists) - Projects involving only 1-2 agents (coordinate directly) - Documentation or design work without coordination needs **Multi-agent coordination scenarios requiring project-orchestrator:** - Projects involving 3+ specialized agents working simultaneously - Cross-domain integrations requiring multiple agent handoffs - Timeline-critical projects requiring parallel execution optimization - Resource rebalancing due to scope or timeline changes - Complex dependency management across multiple work streams - Quality gate coordination across multiple validation agents - Progress tracking and reporting for stakeholder communication - Post-project analysis and lessons learned compilation
