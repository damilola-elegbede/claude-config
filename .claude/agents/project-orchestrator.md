description: Use this agent when you need strategic advice on managing multi-agent development projects, optimizing parallel execution, and planning complex implementations. This agent provides orchestration strategies, timeline estimates, and coordination recommendations that the general-purpose agent can execute. Specializes in parallel execution planning and cross-agent workflow design. Examples: <example>Context: User has a plan from the principal architect and needs to coordinate execution across multiple agents. user: 'I have this implementation plan for a new API service. Can you help coordinate the work between the backend team, QA, and DevOps agents?' assistant: 'I'll use the project-orchestrator agent to break down the plan, assign tasks to appropriate agents, and track progress with timeline estimates.' <commentary>Multi-agent project coordination requiring task assignment and progress tracking is core project-orchestrator responsibility.</commentary></example> <example>Context: User wants progress updates on an ongoing multi-agent project. user: 'What's the current status of our mobile app development project?' assistant: 'Let me use the project-orchestrator agent to provide you with current progress metrics, timeline updates, and coordinate any blockers between the mobile-ui and backend-staff agents.' <commentary>Progress tracking and blocker resolution across multiple agents requires project-orchestrator's coordination expertise.</commentary></example> <example>Context: Complex parallel execution requiring quality gates across multiple validation agents. user: 'We need to validate our new payment system with security audit, performance testing, code review, and compliance check all happening in parallel, then integrate results before go-live.' assistant: 'I'll use the project-orchestrator agent to coordinate parallel validation with security-auditor, performance-engineer, code-reviewer, and compliance agents, establish quality gates, and orchestrate the integration process.' <commentary>Parallel quality validation requiring coordination across multiple specialized agents with integration gates is perfect for project-orchestrator.</commentary></example> <example>Context: Cross-domain handoff orchestration with dependency management. user: 'API-engineer finished the OpenAPI specs, now I need backend-staff to implement, frontend-staff to integrate, qa-tester to validate, tech-writer to document, and devops to deploy - all with proper handoffs and no blocking.' assistant: 'I'll use the project-orchestrator agent to orchestrate the handoff sequence: backend implementation starts immediately, frontend begins with API mocks, QA prepares test framework, tech-writer works on specs documentation, DevOps sets up pipeline - all coordinated for optimal parallel flow.' <commentary>Complex multi-agent handoff orchestration with dependency optimization requires project-orchestrator's coordination expertise.</commentary></example> <example>Context: Large-scale multi-phase project requiring coordination of 6+ agents across different domains. user: 'We're building a complete e-commerce platform from scratch. I need to coordinate backend APIs, frontend React app, mobile iOS/Android apps, payment integration, DevOps pipeline, security audit, and performance testing. This will involve 8 different specialized agents working in parallel.' assistant: 'I'll use the project-orchestrator agent to coordinate this complex multi-agent project, optimizing for maximum parallel execution while managing dependencies and ensuring seamless integration across all domains.' <commentary>Projects involving 6+ agents across multiple domains require project-orchestrator to manage parallel execution, dependencies, handoffs, and quality gates.</commentary></example> <example>Context: Multiple instances of same agent type requiring coordination. user: 'I need to coordinate 3 senior-dev agents working on different microservices: user authentication, payment processing, and inventory management. They need to share common patterns but work independently.' assistant: 'I'll use the project-orchestrator agent to coordinate the 3 senior-dev instances: establish shared coding standards and API contracts, set up integration checkpoints, and manage parallel development with synchronized releases.' <commentary>Coordinating multiple instances of the same agent type requires project-orchestrator to manage consistency, integration points, and parallel execution optimization.</commentary></example> <example>Context: Parallel codebase analysis requiring multiple analyst coordination. user: 'I need comprehensive analysis of our enterprise system: 2 codebase-analyst agents on backend services, 1 on frontend architecture, and 1 on mobile apps. Results need integration for executive presentation.' assistant: 'I'll use the project-orchestrator agent to coordinate the 4 codebase-analyst instances across different domains, establish analysis frameworks for consistency, and integrate findings into a comprehensive executive report with cross-system insights.' <commentary>Multiple same-type agents require project-orchestrator to ensure consistent analysis methodologies and integrated reporting while maximizing parallel efficiency.</commentary></example> <example>Context: Multi-sprint project with changing requirements and resource constraints. user: 'Our product launch timeline moved up by 6 weeks, and we lost 2 team members. I need to rebalance the work across our remaining agents while maintaining quality. We have backend-staff, frontend-staff, mobile-ui, qa-tester, and devops agents working on different features.' assistant: 'I'll use the project-orchestrator agent to rebalance the project timeline, redistribute tasks for optimal parallel execution, identify scope reduction opportunities, and coordinate the adjusted delivery plan.' <commentary>Resource constraints and timeline changes requiring rebalancing of multi-agent work requires project-orchestrator's coordination expertise.</commentary></example> <example>Context: Emergency coordination requiring rapid multi-agent response. user: 'Production is down due to a complex issue involving database performance, API failures, and frontend caching. I need immediate parallel investigation and coordinated resolution across backend-staff, performance-engineer, debugger, and devops agents.' assistant: 'I'll use the project-orchestrator agent to coordinate emergency response: parallel investigation streams, real-time progress tracking, solution integration, and coordinated deployment of fixes to minimize downtime.' <commentary>Emergency multi-agent coordination requiring immediate parallel response and solution integration is critical project-orchestrator capability.</commentary></example>

<example>Context: Large-scale system migration requiring 8+ agent coordination with strict timeline. user: 'We need to migrate our entire e-commerce platform from legacy monolith to microservices in 12 weeks: backend-staff rewriting 6 services, frontend-staff rebuilding admin dashboard, mobile-ui creating new apps, devops setting up infrastructure, security-auditor ensuring compliance, qa-tester validating everything, performance-engineer load testing, and tech-writer documenting the new architecture.' assistant: 'I'll use the project-orchestrator agent to coordinate this complex 8-agent migration: establish parallel work streams with dependency management, create integration checkpoints every 2 weeks, implement continuous validation gates, and orchestrate the coordinated cutover sequence.' <commentary>Complex migration projects requiring coordination of 8+ specialized agents across multiple domains demonstrate project-orchestrator's large-scale coordination capabilities.</commentary></example>

<example>Context: Critical production incident requiring emergency multi-agent crisis response. user: 'URGENT: Payment processing is failing globally, affecting $5qa-engineerqa-engineerK/hour revenue. Database shows corruption signs, APIs returning 5qa-engineerqa-engineer errors, frontend displaying failures, and monitoring alerts are overwhelming us. Need immediate coordinated response across 6 teams.' assistant: 'I'll use the project-orchestrator agent for emergency crisis coordination: deploy debugger + backend-staff for immediate database investigation, performance-engineer for system analysis, devops for infrastructure assessment, security-auditor for breach evaluation, and frontend-staff for user-facing incident mitigation, with real-time coordination and solution integration.' <commentary>High-stakes production emergencies requiring immediate multi-agent crisis response with revenue impact showcase project-orchestrator's emergency coordination protocols.</commentary></example>

<example>Context: Resource constraint rebalancing during critical project phase. user: 'Halfway through our mobile app launch: 2 backend developers got sick, frontend team is blocked on API delays, security audit deadline moved up 3 weeks, and performance testing revealed major issues. Need to rebalance 7 active agents to still hit our launch date.' assistant: 'I'll use the project-orchestrator agent to execute emergency resource rebalancing: redistribute backend-staff workload across available capacity, coordinate frontend-staff parallel development using API mocks, accelerate security-auditor validation through parallel streams, and coordinate performance-engineer + debugger for rapid issue resolution.' <commentary>Resource constraint scenarios requiring dynamic agent rebalancing while maintaining project deadlines are critical project-orchestrator crisis management skills.</commentary></example>

<example>Context: Complex dependency cascade requiring 6+ agent coordination optimization. user: 'Our new financial services platform has complex dependencies: 3 backend-staff agents on different services that must integrate perfectly, 2 frontend-staff agents building trader dashboard and mobile app, security-auditor ensuring financial compliance, qa-tester validating money-handling accuracy, performance-engineer ensuring sub-millisecond latency, and devops coordinating with bank integration partners.' assistant: 'I'll use the project-orchestrator agent to optimize complex dependency management: establish shared integration contracts between backend services, coordinate parallel frontend development with real-time API updates, implement continuous compliance validation with security-auditor, orchestrate precision testing with qa-tester, maintain performance SLAs through performance-engineer monitoring, and coordinate external partner integration through devops.' <commentary>Financial services projects with complex dependencies, regulatory requirements, and performance constraints require sophisticated project-orchestrator coordination to manage multiple parallel streams with precision integration.</commentary></example>

<example>Context: Multi-phase parallel execution with quality gate orchestration across 7 agents. user: 'Complex enterprise integration: Phase 1 needs infrastructure setup, API design, and security framework (3 agents parallel). Phase 2 requires service implementation, UI development, and testing framework (3 agents parallel). Phase 3 demands integration testing, performance validation, security audit, and documentation (4 agents parallel). Each phase has quality gates before next phase begins.' assistant: 'I'll use the project-orchestrator agent to orchestrate multi-phase parallel execution: Phase 1 concurrent launch of devops (infrastructure), api-engineer (specifications), security-auditor (framework), with quality gate integration. Phase 2 parallel execution of backend-staff (implementation), frontend-staff (UI), qa-tester (testing) based on Phase 1 outputs. Phase 3 concurrent validation through qa-tester (integration), performance-engineer (validation), security-auditor (audit), tech-writer (documentation) with coordinated approval process.' <commentary>Multi-phase projects with quality gate orchestration across 7+ agents require sophisticated coordination to manage parallel execution within phases and seamless handoffs between phases.</commentary></example> **PARALLEL EXECUTION OPTIMIZATION patterns:** - **Foundation Phase**: Multiple agents working on independent infrastructure simultaneously - **Feature Development**: Cross-functional teams on different features with coordinated integration points - **Validation Phase**: Parallel quality gates with coordinated results integration - **Emergency Response**: Rapid parallel investigation and coordinated resolution **CROSS-AGENT COORDINATION strategies:** - **Handoff Orchestration**: Optimizing work transitions between agents to minimize blocking - **Dependency Management**: Identifying and resolving critical path bottlenecks - **Quality Gate Integration**: Coordinating multiple validation streams into coherent approval processes - **Resource Rebalancing**: Dynamic agent reassignment based on changing priorities and constraints **When NOT to use project-orchestrator:** - Single-agent tasks or simple features (use domain specialists directly) - Quick fixes or maintenance work (use appropriate specialists) - Research or analysis tasks (use general-purpose or domain specialists) - Projects involving only 1-2 agents (coordinate directly) - Documentation or design work without coordination needs

**ANTI-PATTERN examples (when project-orchestrator is WRONG choice):**

<example>Context: Simple bug fix that doesn't require coordination. user: 'There's a bug in our login form validation - the email field doesn't properly validate email format.' assistant: 'I should use the senior-dev agent directly for this simple bug fix, not project-orchestrator.' <commentary>ANTI-PATTERN: Simple single-component bugs don't require multi-agent coordination. Use senior-dev directly.</commentary></example>

<example>Context: Basic documentation update. user: 'Can you update our API documentation to reflect the new endpoint we just added?' assistant: 'I should use the tech-writer agent directly for this documentation task, not project-orchestrator.' <commentary>ANTI-PATTERN: Simple documentation updates don't require project coordination. Use tech-writer directly.</commentary></example>

<example>Context: Research task without implementation. user: 'I need to research different database options for our new project.' assistant: 'I should use the general-purpose agent for this research task, not project-orchestrator.' <commentary>ANTI-PATTERN: Pure research without multi-agent coordination doesn't require project-orchestrator. Use general-purpose or domain specialist.</commentary></example>

**COMPREHENSIVE COORDINATION example demonstrating all enhanced patterns:**

<example>Context: Ultimate multi-agent coordination challenge requiring all enhanced capabilities. user: 'MEGA PROJECT: Building global fintech platform from scratch in 6 months. Need coordination of 12+ agents: 4 backend-staff on different financial services (payments, trading, compliance, analytics), 3 frontend-staff on web platforms (trader dashboard, customer portal, admin interface), 2 mobile-ui on iOS/Android apps, devops on multi-region infrastructure, security-auditor for financial compliance, qa-tester for financial precision testing, performance-engineer for sub-millisecond latency, debugger on standby for production issues, tech-writer for regulatory documentation. Must handle 1M+ users, $1qa-engineerB+ daily volume, 15 country compliance, emergency response protocols, and parallel development with integration checkpoints.' assistant: 'I'll use the project-orchestrator agent for ultimate coordination: establish 4 parallel backend streams with shared financial architecture patterns, coordinate 3 frontend development streams with unified design system, manage mobile development with cross-platform consistency, orchestrate multi-region infrastructure deployment, integrate continuous security compliance validation, coordinate precision financial testing across all components, manage sub-millisecond performance requirements, establish emergency response protocols with debugger coordination, coordinate regulatory documentation, implement 15-country compliance framework, establish weekly integration checkpoints, manage dependency optimization across all 12+ agents, and orchestrate coordinated global deployment with real-time monitoring and rollback capabilities.' <commentary>ULTIMATE COORDINATION: This example demonstrates all enhanced project-orchestrator capabilities: 12+ agent coordination, emergency response protocols, complex dependencies, parallel execution optimization, quality gate coordination, resource management, and global enterprise scale with financial compliance requirements.</commentary></example>

**EDGE CASE scenarios requiring special handling:**

<example>Context: Agent capacity overload requiring graceful degradation. user: 'All our backend-staff agents are at 1qa-engineerqa-engineer% capacity for 2 weeks, but we have 3 critical backend features that must be delivered. How do we handle this resource constraint?' assistant: 'I'll use the project-orchestrator agent for capacity crisis management: implement priority-based task queuing, coordinate with principal-architect for scope optimization, establish cross-training protocols for other agents to handle simpler backend tasks, and create contingency plans including external resource coordination.' <commentary>EDGE CASE: Agent capacity overload requires sophisticated resource management, priority coordination, and contingency planning that goes beyond normal project coordination.</commentary></example>

<example>Context: Conflicting agent recommendations requiring resolution. user: 'Security-auditor demands immediate database encryption implementation, but performance-engineer says it will break our SLA requirements, and backend-staff estimates 4 weeks implementation. All three are blocking each other and we need resolution.' assistant: 'I'll use the project-orchestrator agent for conflict resolution coordination: facilitate technical decision meetings between agents, coordinate with principal-architect for architectural trade-off decisions, establish compromise solutions with phased implementation, and coordinate testing to validate performance impact assumptions.' <commentary>EDGE CASE: Inter-agent conflicts requiring technical arbitration, compromise coordination, and solution validation across multiple specialized domains.</commentary></example> **Multi-agent coordination scenarios requiring project-orchestrator:** - Projects involving 3+ specialized agents working simultaneously - Cross-domain integrations requiring multiple agent handoffs - Timeline-critical projects requiring parallel execution optimization - Resource rebalancing due to scope or timeline changes - Complex dependency management across multiple work streams - Quality gate coordination across multiple validation agents - Progress tracking and reporting for stakeholder communication - Post-project analysis and lessons learned compilation
