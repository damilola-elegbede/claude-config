# Architecture Review Board (ARB) Pattern

## Overview
The Architecture Review Board is a virtual coordination pattern that brings together specialized agents for critical architectural decisions, ensuring comprehensive evaluation from multiple perspectives.

## Board Composition

### Core Members
- **principal-architect** (Chair): Overall system architecture and strategic direction
- **api-designer**: API design standards and integration patterns  
- **security-auditor**: Security architecture and compliance requirements
- **performance-engineer**: Performance implications and scalability

### Situational Members
- **data-engineer**: When data architecture is involved
- **ml-engineer**: For AI/ML architectural decisions
- **platform-engineer**: For infrastructure and platform decisions
- **business-analyst**: For business impact assessment

## Review Triggers

### Mandatory Review Scenarios
1. **New System Architecture**: Any new system or major component
2. **Technology Stack Changes**: Framework, language, or platform changes
3. **Integration Patterns**: New integration approaches or partners
4. **Security Architecture**: Authentication, authorization, or data protection changes
5. **Data Architecture**: Schema changes affecting multiple systems
6. **Scalability Changes**: Architectural changes for scale (>10x growth)

### Review Thresholds
```yaml
review_required:
  new_services: ">3 microservices"
  user_impact: ">10k users affected"
  data_volume: ">1TB data architecture"
  integration_count: ">5 system integrations"
  cost_impact: ">$100k infrastructure"
  security_level: "PII or financial data"
```

## Review Process

### 1. Submission Phase
```yaml
arb_submission:
  submitter: [any-agent]
  required_documents:
    - architecture_proposal.md
    - technical_design.md
    - risk_assessment.md
    - alternatives_analysis.md
  optional_documents:
    - proof_of_concept.md
    - performance_benchmarks.md
    - cost_analysis.md
```

### 2. Review Phase
Each board member reviews from their perspective:

**principal-architect**:
- Overall architecture alignment
- Strategic technology fit
- Long-term maintainability
- Enterprise pattern compliance

**api-designer**:
- API design standards
- Integration patterns
- Contract compatibility
- Versioning strategy

**security-auditor**:
- Security architecture
- Compliance requirements
- Data protection
- Access control design

**performance-engineer**:
- Scalability assessment
- Performance implications
- Resource utilization
- Bottleneck analysis

### 3. Deliberation Phase
```yaml
arb_deliberation:
  format: structured_review
  sections:
    - strengths: "What works well"
    - concerns: "Issues to address"
    - risks: "Potential problems"
    - recommendations: "Suggested improvements"
  decision_types:
    - approved: "Proceed as proposed"
    - conditional: "Approved with modifications"
    - deferred: "Needs more information"
    - rejected: "Fundamental issues"
```

### 4. Decision Phase
```yaml
arb_decision:
  voting_members:
    - principal-architect: 2  # Double weight
    - api-designer: 1
    - security-auditor: 1  # Veto power on security
    - performance-engineer: 1
  consensus_required: true
  veto_rights:
    security-auditor: "security_concerns"
    principal-architect: "strategic_misalignment"
```

## Review Templates

### Architecture Proposal Template
```markdown
# Architecture Proposal: [System Name]

## Executive Summary
Brief overview of the proposed architecture

## Business Context
- Business drivers
- Success criteria
- Constraints

## Technical Architecture
### System Overview
- High-level architecture diagram
- Component descriptions
- Data flow

### Technology Stack
- Languages and frameworks
- Infrastructure requirements
- Third-party services

### Integration Points
- Internal system integrations
- External API dependencies
- Data exchange patterns

## Non-Functional Requirements
### Performance
- Expected load
- Response time requirements
- Scalability approach

### Security
- Authentication/authorization
- Data protection
- Compliance requirements

### Reliability
- Availability targets
- Failure handling
- Recovery procedures

## Alternatives Considered
- Option 1: Description and why rejected
- Option 2: Description and why rejected

## Risks and Mitigations
- Technical risks
- Business risks
- Mitigation strategies

## Implementation Approach
- High-level phases
- Key milestones
- Dependencies
```

### Review Checklist
- [ ] Architecture aligns with enterprise patterns
- [ ] Security requirements addressed
- [ ] Performance targets achievable
- [ ] API contracts well-defined
- [ ] Integration patterns appropriate
- [ ] Scalability approach validated
- [ ] Operational requirements considered
- [ ] Cost implications understood
- [ ] Risk mitigations adequate
- [ ] Alternative approaches evaluated

## Decision Records

### ADR (Architecture Decision Record) Format
```markdown
# ADR-[NUMBER]: [TITLE]

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]

## Context
The issue motivating this decision

## Decision
The architectural decision made

## Consequences
The resulting context after applying the decision

## Review Board Assessment
- principal-architect: [Approved/Concerns]
- api-designer: [Approved/Concerns]
- security-auditor: [Approved/Concerns]
- performance-engineer: [Approved/Concerns]

## Conditions
Any conditions attached to the approval
```

## Escalation and Appeals

### Escalation Path
1. **Technical Disagreement**: Escalate to principal-architect for final decision
2. **Business Impact**: Include business-analyst and product-strategy
3. **Security Veto**: Can only be overridden by executive security approval
4. **Cost Concerns**: Include financial stakeholders in review

### Appeal Process
- Submitter can appeal decision with new information
- Requires addressing all stated concerns
- Re-review by full board required
- Maximum one appeal per proposal

## Continuous Improvement

### Metrics Tracking
- Average review time
- Approval/rejection rates
- Condition compliance rate
- Architecture debt accumulation
- Decision reversal frequency

### Process Optimization
- Quarterly review of ARB effectiveness
- Streamline for low-risk changes
- Automate compliance checking
- Improve template clarity
- Enhance decision tracking

## Integration with Development

### Pre-ARB Consultation
Developers can request informal architecture guidance before formal submission

### Post-Approval Support
Board members provide implementation guidance as needed

### Compliance Monitoring
Regular architecture reviews ensure ongoing compliance with ARB decisions
