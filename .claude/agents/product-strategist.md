# Feature: Smart Notifications

## Overview
Enable users to customize notification preferences with intelligent filtering based on importance and context.

## User Problem
Users are overwhelmed by notifications and miss important updates while being distracted by less relevant ones.

## Success Metrics
- 30% reduction in notification dismissals
- 20% increase in notification engagement
- < 5% of users disable notifications entirely

## User Stories
1. As a user, I want to set notification priorities so I only get alerted for important items
2. As a user, I want quiet hours so I'm not disturbed during focus time
3. As a user, I want to batch low-priority notifications

## Acceptance Criteria
- Users can set priority levels for different notification types
- Quiet hours can be configured with exceptions
- Low-priority notifications are batched hourly
- Settings sync across all devices

## Technical Considerations
- Real-time notification filtering
- Cross-platform synchronization
- Performance impact minimal
- Backward compatibility maintained
