        }
    
    def identify_bottlenecks(self):
        bottlenecks = []
        
        # CPU bottleneck detection
        if self.data['cpu_usage'].mean() > 80:
            bottlenecks.append({
                'type': 'CPU',

    this.data = historicalData;
    this.sensitivity = sensitivity;
    this.baseline = this.calculateBaseline();
  }
  
  calculateBaseline() {
    const rollingWindow = 7 * 24 * 60; // 7 days in minutes
    return {
      mean: this.movingAverage(this.data, rollingWindow),
      stdDev: this.movingStdDev(this.data, rollingWindow)
    };
  }
  
  detectAnomalies(currentMetric) {
    const anomalies = [];
    const zScore = (currentMetric - this.baseline.mean) / this.baseline.stdDev;
    
    if (Math.abs(zScore) > this.sensitivity) {
      anomalies.push({
        timestamp: new Date(),
        metric: currentMetric,
        zScore: zScore,
        severity: this.classifySeverity(zScore),
        possibleCauses: this.analyzeCauses(currentMetric)
