# /ml Command

## Description
Quickly access machine learning expertise through Claude orchestration for ML and AI tasks. Claude will coordinate with the ml-staff specialist for ML model development, deployment, and MLOps practices.

## Behavior
This command coordinates with the ml-staff specialist to deploy ML models, build MLOps pipelines, and implement production-ready machine learning systems at scale.

## Usage
```
/ml [task description]
```

## Examples
- `/ml implement recommendation system`
- `/ml optimize model inference performance`
- `/ml build ML training pipeline`
- `/ml deploy model to production`

## Capabilities
The ml-staff specialist (coordinated through Claude) excels at:
- ML model development and training
- Model optimization and deployment
- MLOps pipeline implementation
- Feature engineering
- Model serving infrastructure
- A/B testing frameworks
- Model monitoring and drift detection

## When to Use
- Building ML models
- ML pipeline development
- Model deployment and serving
- Performance optimization for inference
