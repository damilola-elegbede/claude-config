              "content": "# Calendar Feature Implementation Instructions\n\n## Overview\nReplace the \"Today\" tab with a Calendar tab that shows today's quote by default but allows full calendar navigation.\n\n## Tab Bar Update\n\n### 1. Replace Today Tab Icon\n   - Change from house icon to calendar icon with day number\n   - Use SF Symbol: `calendar` as base\n   - Overlay current day number (e.g., \"15\" for the 15th)\n   - Update dynamically each day\n\n   ```swift\n   // Tab icon should show:\n   Image(systemName: \"calendar\")\n       .overlay(\n           Text(\"\\(Calendar.current.component(.day, from: Date()))\")\n               .font(.caption2)\n               .bold()\n       )\n   ```\n\n### 2. Tab Behavior\n   - Default view when tapped: Today's quote (same as current Today view)\n   - Add calendar navigation button in top toolbar\n   - Tapping tab when already selected: Return to today\n\n## Calendar Navigation\n\n### 1. Add Calendar Button to Toolbar\n   In the quote view (formerly Today view):\n   ```swift\n   .toolbar {\n       ToolbarItem(placement: .navigationBarTrailing) {\n           Button(action: { showCalendar = true }) {\n               Image(systemName: \"calendar.badge.plus\")\n           }\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n### 2. Calendar Picker View\n   Create `CalendarPickerView.swift`:\n   - Month/year header with arrows\n   - Standard 7-day week grid\n   - Highlights:\n       - Today: Bold blue border\n       - Selected date: Filled background\n       - Viewed dates: Small dot indicator\n\n### 3. Navigation Flow\n   ```\n   Calendar Tab (default: today) → Calendar Icon in Toolbar → Month View → Select Date → Quote for that date\n   ```\n\n## Quote Assignment Logic\n\n### 1. Create `Utils/QuoteScheduler.swift`\n   ```swift\n   import Foundation\n\n   struct QuoteScheduler {\n       static func quoteIndex(for date: Date, totalQuotes: Int) -> Int {\n           let calendar = Calendar.current\n           let components = calendar.dateComponents([.year, .month, .day], from: date)\n           \n           // Create deterministic seed from date\n           let seed = (components.year! * 10000) + \n                     (components.month! * 100) + \n                     components.day!\n           \n           // Use linear congruential generator for consistency\n           let a = 1664525\n           let c = 1013904223\n           let m = Int(pow(2.0, 32.0))\n           \n           let randomValue = (a * seed + c) % m\n           return abs(randomValue) % totalQuotes\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n### 2. Update QuoteViewModel\n   ```swift\n   func quote(for date: Date) -> Quote {\n       let index = QuoteScheduler.quoteIndex(for: date, totalQuotes: quotes.count)\n       return quotes[index]\n   }\n\n   func loadQuote(for date: Date) {\n       currentQuote = quote(for: date)\n       currentDate = date\n   }\n   ```\n\n## UI Updates\n\n### 1. Update Current Quote View\n   - Add date display below \"The Wise Executive\" header\n   - Format: \"Wednesday, January 15, 2025\"\n   - If viewing past/future date, show indicator\n\n### 2. Add Navigation Controls\n   When viewing a non-today date:\n   ```swift\n   HStack {\n       Button(\"Previous\") {\n           currentDate = Calendar.current.date(byAdding: .day, value: -1, to: currentDate)!\n       }\n       \n       Spacer()\n       \n       Button(\"Today\") {\n           currentDate = Date()\n       }\n       \n       Spacer()\n       \n       Button(\"Next\") {\n           currentDate = Calendar.current.date(byAdding: .day, value: 1, to: currentDate)!\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n## Calendar Picker Implementation\n\n### 1. Month View Grid\n   ```swift\n   LazyVGrid(columns: Array(repeating: GridItem(.flexible()), count: 7)) {\n       // Day headers\n       ForEach([\"S\", \"M\", \"T\", \"W\", \"T\", \"F\", \"S\"], id: \\.self) { day in\n           Text(day)\n               .font(.caption)\n               .foregroundColor(.gray)\n       }\n       \n       // Calendar days\n       ForEach(daysInMonth, id: \\.self) { date in\n           DayCell(date: date, isToday: isToday(date), isSelected: isSelected(date))\n               .onTapGesture {\n                   selectedDate = date\n                   dismiss()\n               }\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n### 2. Viewed Dates Tracking\n   ```swift\n   // In QuoteViewModel\n   @Published var viewedDates: Set<String> = []\n\n   func markDateAsViewed(_ date: Date) {\n       let key = dateKey(for: date)\n       viewedDates.insert(key)\n       // Save to UserDefaults\n   }\n   ```\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\n### 1. Lazy Loading\n   - Only calculate quotes when date is selected\n   - Don't pre-generate all assignments\n\n### 2. Cache Current Month\n   - Pre-calculate current month's assignments\n   - Refresh cache on month change\n\n### 3. Limit Range\n   - Support 2020-2030 initially\n   - Extend as needed\n\n### 4. Background Updates\n   - Update tab badge at midnight\n   - Refresh \"today\" designation\n\n## Executive-Specific Features\n\n### 1. Week Preview\n   - Long-press on calendar to preview week's themes\n   - Show topic distribution for planning\n\n### 2. Quarter View\n   - Option to see 90-day wisdom themes\n   - Useful for quarterly planning\n\n### 3. Anniversary Quotes\n   - \"This day last year\" comparison\n   - Track growth and recurring themes\n\n### 4. Export Options\n   - Send month's wisdom to assistant\n   - Calendar integration for planning\n\n## Implementation Order\n\n### Phase 1: Core Calendar\n   1. Update tab bar icon with day number\n   2. Keep current \"Today\" view as default\n   3. Add calendar navigation button\n   4. Implement calendar picker\n\n### Phase 2: Quote Logic\n   5. Add quote scheduling logic\n   6. Update navigation between dates\n   7. Add viewed date tracking\n   8. Test date consistency\n\n### Phase 3: Polish\n   9. Add animations and transitions\n   10. Implement executive features\n   11. Performance optimization\n   12. Edge case handling"

Write like you're having coffee with a CEO friend - direct, insightful, no fluff\n2. One powerful example per insight, not multiple scattered references\n3. Industry-agnostic - applicable whether they run a bank or a biotech\n4. 4-6 sentences maximum - respects their time\n5. Each insight must feel like it's worth $10,000 of consulting fees\n\nSTRUCTURE FOR EACH INSIGHT:\n1. Opening hook that connects ancient wisdom to modern reality (1 sentence)\n2. Single compelling example that proves the point (2-3 sentences)\n3. The takeaway that changes how they think (1-2 sentences)\n\nWHAT TO AVOID:\n- Multiple examples that dilute impact\n- Generic business school language\n- Obvious observations\n- Name-dropping without purpose\n- Inspirational fluff without substance\n\nEXAMPLE OF THE TRANSFORMATION:\n\nBEFORE (current style):\n\"Your team doesn't need another mission statement. They need to see you living it. When Howard Schultz returned to Starbucks in 2008, he didn't give speeches about customer experience—he closed 7,100 stores to retrain baristas. He worked shifts himself, remembering customer names. Actions create culture; words create memos. Ray Kroc didn't tell McDonald's franchisees about quality—he showed up at 5 AM to inspect parking lots. Your next all-hands speech matters less than what you do after it ends.\"\n\nAFTER (new style):\n\"Philosophy without execution is just expensive consulting. When Alan Mulally took over Ford in 2006, he didn't pontificate about transparency—he simply started sharing financials openly in weekly meetings, admitting he didn't understand half of them. Within months, executives went from hiding problems to competing to surface them first. Your team mirrors your actual behavior, not your aspirational PowerPoints.\"\n\nANOTHER EXAMPLE:\n\nQuote: \"Discipline equals freedom.\" - Jocko Willink\n\nBEFORE (too many examples):\n\"This principle from 'Extreme Ownership' revolutionizes executive thinking. Disciplined processes free you from firefighting. When Bezos implemented disciplined writing (6-page memos), it freed meetings from PowerPoint theater. CEO Excellence calls this 'simplifying to amplify'—constraints that create clarity. Netflix's disciplined 'keeper test' frees managers from performance theater. The executive who embraces disciplined systems gains freedom to focus on strategy, not chaos.\"\n\nAFTER (single example, deeper insight):\n\"Every constraint you accept eliminates a thousand decisions. Jensen Huang runs NVIDIA with one rule: no status meetings, only problem-solving ones. This discipline freed 30% of executive time for actual thinking. Most leaders fear constraints because they confuse flexibility with freedom—but watch how the highest performers embrace rigid routines to create space for breakthrough thinking.\"\n\nPLEASE PROVIDE 20 REVISED EXECUTIVE INSIGHTS:\nTake the first 20 quotes from our QuoteData.swift file and rewrite their Executive Insights following these guidelines. Show me the quote text, author, and both the OLD and NEW versions of the Executive Insight for each.\n\nAfter I approve the style and quality of these 20 examples, you'll apply this same approach to all 434 quotes in our database.\n\nREMEMBER:\n- You're a peer who's been there, not a professor\n- One perfect example beats three good ones\n- The insight should change how they see their next decision\n- If it sounds like it could be in any business book, rewrite it\n```"

Critical requirements:\n\n1. SOURCE VERIFICATION:\n   - ONLY use quotes that are directly from Stoic texts:\n     * Marcus Aurelius - \"Meditations\"\n     * Epictetus - \"Discourses\" and \"Enchiridion\"\n     * Seneca - His letters and essays\n     * Zeno of Citium - Fragments\n     * Cleanthes - \"Hymn to Zeus\" and fragments\n     * Chrysippus - Fragments\n     * Musonius Rufus - Lectures\n     * Cato the Younger - Recorded sayings\n   - Each quote MUST be historically attributed to these Stoics\n   - NO modern paraphrases or inspirational quotes incorrectly attributed to Stoics\n\n2. DISTRIBUTION:\n   - 40% Marcus Aurelius (Roman Emperor perspective)\n   - 30% Epictetus (Practical wisdom)\n   - 20% Seneca (Statesman/advisor angle)\n   - 10% Other Stoics (Zeno, Cleanthes, etc.)\n\n3. EXECUTIVE INSIGHT SECTION:\n   - Change \"The Application\" label to \"Executive Insight\"\n   - Each insight should blend Stoic wisdom with modern executive thinking\n   - Reference concepts from leadership books like:\n     * \"CEO Excellence\" by Dewar, Keller, and Malhotra\n     * \"Your Next Five Moves\" by Patrick Bet-David\n     * \"Good to Great\" by Jim Collins\n     * \"The Five Dysfunctions of a Team\" by Patrick Lencioni\n     * \"Measure What Matters\" by John Doerr\n     * \"The Hard Thing About Hard Things\" by Ben Horowitz\n   - Example: \"This echoes CEO Excellence's emphasis on bold moves during crisis. When Nadella took over Microsoft...\"\n   - 5-8 sentences mixing Stoic principles with modern frameworks\n\n4. TOPICS - Ensure coverage across:\n   - Leadership (25%)\n   - Decision Making (20%)\n   - Crisis Management (15%)\n   - Innovation (10%)\n   - Focus/Priorities (10%)\n   - Team/Culture (10%)\n   - Ethics/Integrity (10%)\n\n5. FORMAT for each quote:\n   Quote(\n       id: UUID(),\n       text: \"[Exact quote from Stoic text]\",\n       author: \"[Stoic philosopher name]\",\n       executiveContext: \"[5-8 sentences blending Stoic wisdom with insights from executive leadership books and real examples]\",\n       topics: [\"Primary Topic\", \"Secondary Topic\"],\n       morningPrompt: \"[Question for morning reflection]\",\n       eveningReflection: \"[Question for evening review]\"\n   ),\n\n6. EXAMPLE of new Executive Insight style:\n   executiveContext: \"This aligns with Patrick Bet-David's 'Your Next Five Moves' framework—thinking multiple steps ahead while controlling only your next action. When Reed Hastings split Netflix into streaming and DVDs, he saw five moves ahead while Wall Street saw only one. The Stoic discipline of controlling your response, combined with strategic foresight, creates what CEO Excellence calls 'bold moves with humble execution.' Amazon's AWS emerged from this thinking—Bezos controlled the decision to invest while accepting he couldn't control market reception. The executive who masters both internal control and external vision wins long-term.\"\n\n7. QUALITY CHECKS:\n   - Verify each quote appears in legitimate Stoic sources\n   - Each insight must reference at least one leadership concept/book\n   - No duplicate quotes or recycled insights\n   - Balance ancient wisdom with modern application\n\nStart with quotes 21-100, focusing on Marcus Aurelius and Epictetus. Ensure each Executive Insight bridges 2,000-year-old wisdom with today's leadership literature.\n```"

              "content": "**Updated instructions for Claude Code:**\n\n```\nPlease update the executive contexts in QuoteData.swift to focus primarily on modern business application. Here are the revised versions:\n\n1. For \"You have power over your mind—not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength.\" - Marcus Aurelius:\n\nexecutiveContext: \"Every executive faces uncontrollable externalities: market crashes, supply chain disruptions, activist investors, regulatory changes, or viral social media crises. Your power lies not in preventing these events but in choosing your response. The leaders who thrive understand this distinction—they waste zero energy on what they cannot control and channel everything into their response strategy.\\n\\nWhen Adobe faced the existential threat of mobile computing making their desktop software obsolete, they didn't waste energy lamenting the iPhone's arrival or fighting the inevitable shift. Instead, they controlled what they could—pivoting their entire business model to Creative Cloud subscriptions despite massive internal resistance and customer complaints. The market rewarded their focused response with a 10x stock increase. Similarly, when Microsoft's Satya Nadella inherited a company being disrupted on all fronts, he focused only on what he could control: culture change, cloud investment, and partnership strategies. The external threats remained, but the internal response transformed a declining giant into a $3 trillion company.\",\n\n2. For \"It's not what happens to you, but how you react to it that matters.\" - Epictetus:\n\nexecutiveContext: \"Crisis reveals character, and more importantly, it builds brands. When Tylenol faced cyanide poisoning deaths in 1982, Johnson & Johnson's reaction—immediately pulling $100 million in product and pioneering tamper-proof packaging—became the gold standard for crisis response. They couldn't control the tampering, but their response built even greater trust. The poisonings could have destroyed the brand; instead, their reaction strengthened it beyond pre-crisis levels.\\n\\nThis principle extends beyond crisis to everyday leadership. When Netflix's Reed Hastings made the disastrous Qwikster decision, splitting DVD and streaming services, he faced brutal criticism and lost 800,000 subscribers. His reaction? Complete ownership, rapid reversal, and transparent communication about the mistake. No excuses, no scapegoating. This response rebuilt trust and positioned Netflix for streaming dominance. Your next setback—whether a failed product launch, key talent departure, or earnings miss—won't define your leadership. Your response will. Markets and teams forget mistakes but remember character.\",\n\n3. For \"The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way.\" - Marcus Aurelius:\n\nexecutiveContext: \"Southwest Airlines faced the obstacle of competing against established carriers with hub-and-spoke models, massive fleets, and locked-up gates at major airports. Instead of seeing these as barriers, they made them their entire strategy. Flying point-to-point from secondary airports, turning planes in 10 minutes, and eliminating complexity became their competitive advantage. The obstacles weren't problems to solve—they were the solution itself.\\n\\nThis principle drives breakthrough innovation. When Stripe's Collison brothers faced the obstacle of complex payment processing that took weeks to integrate, they didn't just improve the process—they made simplicity their core product. 'Seven lines of code' became their rallying cry. When Airbnb faced hotel industry regulations designed to block them, they turned community mobilization into a core competency, making hosts their legislative advocates. Today's obstacles—privacy regulations, AI ethics concerns, climate mandates—aren't blocking your path forward. They're revealing opportunities your less creative competitors will miss.\",\n\n4. For \"If you want to improve, be content to be thought foolish and stupid.\" - Epictetus:\n\nexecutiveContext: \"Executive suites often become echo chambers where appearing omniscient matters more than being effective. Yet the greatest business transformations came from leaders willing to look foolish. When Satya Nadella took over Microsoft, he publicly admitted the company had lost its way—heresy after the Ballmer era of projecting strength. He asked 'stupid' questions: Why do we hate Linux? Why aren't we in cloud? His willingness to appear foolish while learning transformed Microsoft from a declining giant to passing Apple in market value.\\n\\nJeff Bezos institutionalized this with 'Day 1' thinking and his 'disagree and commit' framework. He regularly admits ignorance in meetings, asks basic questions, and changes his mind publicly when presented with better data. Ray Dalio built the world's largest hedge fund on 'radical transparency' where junior analysts are encouraged to call him wrong. The leaders who never look foolish are the ones who stop learning. Your next 'stupid' question in a board meeting might reveal the blind spot everyone's been politely ignoring.\",\n\n5. For \"How much trouble he avoids who does not look to see what his neighbor says or does.\" - Marcus Aurelius:\n\nexecutiveContext: \"While competitive intelligence matters, obsessing over competitors' every move creates reactive, me-too strategies. When Apple launched the iPhone, Microsoft's Steve Ballmer famously mocked it while frantically trying to copy it with Windows Mobile, wasting billions chasing Apple's vision instead of finding their own. Meanwhile, Amazon barely acknowledged the iPhone, instead focusing on AWS and revolutionizing cloud computing. They won by ignoring the industry's mobile obsession.\\n\\nThis applies to talent strategies, product roadmaps, and marketing approaches. When everyone rushed to copy Google's perks—free food, nap pods, slides—they missed what actually mattered: Google's promotion of psychological safety and data-driven decisions. Copying surface-level competitor moves distracts from deeper strategic thinking. Check competitive moves quarterly, not daily. Your customers' unmet needs deserve more attention than your competitors' press releases. The next time someone says 'But Company X is doing this,' ask instead: 'But what do our customers need?'\",\n\n6. For \"Wealth consists not in having great possessions, but in having few wants.\" - Epictetus:\n\nexecutiveContext: \"Amazon ran unprofitably for years because Bezos wanted few things: customer satisfaction and market share over quarterly earnings. This 'poverty' of wants—refusing to chase multiple metrics—enabled long-term dominance. While competitors optimized for margin, revenue growth, AND market share, Amazon's singular focus let them execute better on what mattered. Their constraint became their strength.\\n\\nCostco maintains fanatical discipline around a single want: keeping member prices low. They ignore consultants pushing higher margins, product diversification, or premium tiers. By wanting fewer things than competitors, they execute better on what matters. In-N-Out Burger wants one thing: perfect burgers. Not breakfast, not salads, not global expansion. This simplicity drives excellence. Complexity is poverty; simplicity is wealth. What are you willing to not want in order to achieve what truly matters?\",\n\n7. For \"The best revenge is not to be like your enemy.\" - Marcus Aurelius:\n\nexecutiveContext: \"When Uber engaged in aggressive tactics against Lyft—from sabotage to poaching—Lyft's decision not to retaliate but focus on driver satisfaction eventually paid off in public perception and market share. While Uber fought dirty, Lyft built a brand around being the ethical alternative. When competitors slash prices, poach talent, or spread FUD, matching their tactics validates their game and destroys your differentiation.\\n\\nPatagonia built a billion-dollar brand by explicitly refusing to be like traditional apparel companies—choosing environmental activism over quarterly growth. When competitors moved manufacturing to the cheapest locations, Patagonia paid more for sustainable suppliers. When Black Friday meant maximum discounts, they ran 'Don't Buy This Jacket' ads. Your values aren't luxuries to abandon under pressure; they're your ultimate differentiator. The moment you adopt your competitor's ethics, you've already lost—even if you win the immediate battle.\"\n\nPlease update all seven quotes with these business-focused, two-paragraph executive contexts. Make sure to properly format the line breaks with \\n between paragraphs.\n```"

Update Quote Model\n   Remove the separate morning/evening prompts and replace with single daily prompt:\n   \n   ```swift\n   struct Quote {\n       let id: UUID\n       let text: String\n       let author: String\n       let sourceType: String\n       let executiveContext: String\n       let topics: [String]\n       let dailyPrompt: String  // CHANGED: Renamed from morningPrompt\n       // REMOVED: eveningReflection\n   }\n   ```\n\n## 2. Update All Existing Quotes\n   For each quote in QuoteData.swift:\n   - Remove `eveningReflection` property\n   - Rename `morningPrompt` to `dailyPrompt`\n   - Rewrite prompts to be deeper, more reflective\n   \n   Example transformation:\n   ```swift\n   // OLD:\n   morningPrompt: \"What external pressures will you face today that you cannot control?\",\n   eveningReflection: \"Which situations today did you handle by focusing on your response?\"\n   \n   // NEW:\n   dailyPrompt: \"Think of a current challenge consuming your mental energy. What aspects are truly within your control, and what would happen if you fully released attachment to the rest?\"\n   ```\n\n## 3. Update QuoteView UI\n   In the quote detail view:\n   - Add new section titled \"Today's Reflection\" or \"Daily Prompt\"\n   - Display the prompt prominently\n   - Add a \"Set Reminder\" button next to the prompt\n   \n   ```swift\n   VStack(alignment: .leading, spacing: 12) {\n       Text(\"Today's Reflection\")\n           .font(.headline)\n           .foregroundColor(.secondary)\n       \n       Text(quote.dailyPrompt)\n           .font(.body)\n           .padding()\n           .background(Color.gray.opacity(0.1))\n           .cornerRadius(8)\n       \n       Button(action: { schedulePromptReminder() }) {\n           Label(\"Set Reminder\", systemImage: \"bell\")\n               .font(.caption)\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n## 4. Update Notification System\n   In NotificationManager.swift:\n   \n   ### Add new notification type:\n   ```swift\n   enum NotificationType {\n       case dailyQuote      // Existing morning quote\n       case dailyPrompt     // New prompt reminder\n   }\n   ```\n   \n   ### Add prompt reminder scheduling:\n   ```swift\n   func schedulePromptReminder(for date: Date, prompt: String) {\n       let content = UNMutableNotificationContent()\n       content.title = \"Time for Reflection\"\n       content.body = prompt\n       content.sound = .default\n       \n       let components = Calendar.current.dateComponents([.hour, .minute], from: date)\n       let trigger = UNCalendarNotificationTrigger(dateMatching: components, repeats: false)\n       \n       let request = UNNotificationRequest(\n           identifier: \"prompt-\\(date.timeIntervalSince1970)\",\n           content: content,\n           trigger: trigger\n       )\n       \n       UNUserNotificationCenter.current().add(request)\n   }\n   ```\n\n## 5. Update Settings View\n   Add new settings for prompt notifications:\n   \n   ```swift\n   Section(\"Daily Prompt Notifications\") {\n       Toggle(\"Enable Prompt Reminders\", isOn: $enablePromptNotifications)\n           .onChange(of: enablePromptNotifications) { newValue in\n               if !newValue {\n                   notificationManager.cancelAllPromptReminders()\n               }\n           }\n       \n       if enablePromptNotifications {\n           Text(\"Set reminder when viewing daily quote\")\n               .font(.caption)\n               .foregroundColor(.secondary)\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n## 6.

Rewrite All Daily Prompts\n   Transform existing prompts to be deeper and more executive-focused:\n   \n   ### Examples of new prompt style:\n   ```swift\n   // Quote: \"You have power over your mind—not outside events.\"\n   dailyPrompt: \"Consider the biggest stressor in your leadership right now. If you had zero ability to change the external situation but unlimited power over your response, what would shift in your approach?

If you knew your biggest competitor was already building for this future, what would you start tomorrow?\"\n   ```\n\n## 9. Default Settings\n   In app initialization:\n   - Daily quote notification: ON (existing)\n   - Daily prompt notification: OFF (new)\n   - Users must explicitly enable prompt reminders\n\n## 10. Notification Management\n   - Only one prompt reminder active at a time\n   - Setting new reminder cancels previous\n   - Reminder automatically clears after firing\n   - Option to cancel reminder from quote view"

Update Quote Model\n   Remove the separate morning/evening prompts and replace with single daily prompt:\n   \n   ```swift\n   struct Quote {\n       let id: UUID\n       let text: String\n       let author: String\n       let sourceType: String\n       let executiveContext: String\n       let topics: [String]\n       let dailyPrompt: String  // CHANGED: Renamed from morningPrompt\n       // REMOVED: eveningReflection\n   }\n   ```\n\n## 2. Update All Existing Quotes\n   For each quote in QuoteData.swift:\n   - Remove `eveningReflection` property\n   - Rename `morningPrompt` to `dailyPrompt`\n   - Rewrite prompts to be deeper, more reflective\n   \n   Example transformation:\n   ```swift\n   // OLD:\n   morningPrompt: \"What external pressures will you face today that you cannot control?\",\n   eveningReflection: \"Which situations today did you handle by focusing on your response?\"\n   \n   // NEW:\n   dailyPrompt: \"Think of a current challenge consuming your mental energy. What aspects are truly within your control, and what would happen if you fully released attachment to the rest?\"\n   ```\n\n## 3. Update QuoteView UI\n   In the quote detail view:\n   - Add new section titled \"Today's Reflection\" or \"Daily Prompt\"\n   - Display the prompt prominently\n   - Add a \"Set Reminder\" button next to the prompt\n   \n   ```swift\n   VStack(alignment: .leading, spacing: 12) {\n       Text(\"Today's Reflection\")\n           .font(.headline)\n           .foregroundColor(.secondary)\n       \n       Text(quote.dailyPrompt)\n           .font(.body)\n           .padding()\n           .background(Color.gray.opacity(0.1))\n           .cornerRadius(8)\n       \n       Button(action: { schedulePromptReminder() }) {\n           Label(\"Set Reminder\", systemImage: \"bell\")\n               .font(.caption)\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n## 4.
