## üéØ Overview

This repository delivers a **sophisticated Smart Agent Orchestration Framework** for Claude Code CLI, featuring **28 specialized agents** across 8 functional domains with **multi-instance parallelization** delivering **4-6x performance improvements**. The system includes **20 essential commands** with advanced instance pooling architecture that enables multiple agents of the same type to work simultaneously.

Built from the ground up after a comprehensive cleanup that removed 85+ bloat files, this production-ready framework provides intelligent task delegation, massive parallel execution, continuous improvement capabilities, and automatic command verification for enhanced development workflows.

## üåü Key Features

### üß† Smart Agent Orchestration Framework
- **28 Specialized Agents**: Complete coverage across 8 functional domains (Development, Infrastructure, Architecture, Design, Quality, Security, Analysis, Operations)
- **Multi-Instance Parallelization**: Deploy 3-8 instances of the same agent type for 4-6x performance gains
- **Intelligent Task Delegation**: Automatic specialist selection based on task requirements and complexity
- **Continuous Improvement**: Performance feedback loops with adaptive allocation and quality evolution

### ‚ö° Performance Improvements
- **`/agent-audit`**: 5-6x faster (3-5 min ‚Üí 30-45 sec) with 8 parallel instances
- **`/test`**: 4-5x faster (2-3 min ‚Üí 30-40 sec) with intelligent framework discovery
- **`/docs`**: 3-4x faster (5-7 min ‚Üí 1-2 min) with 6 document instances
- **`/context`**: 4-6x faster (1-2 min ‚Üí 15-20 sec) with 5 analyzer instances

### üîÑ Configuration Management
- **One-Command Deployment**: Deploy entire framework with `/sync`
- **Production-Ready**: Battle-tested configurations with comprehensive quality gates
- **Automatic Validation**: YAML compliance and security boundary checking
- **Backup Management**: Automatic backups with rollback capabilities

### üõ°Ô∏è Security & Quality
- **SYSTEM BOUNDARY Protection**: Multi-layered prevention of unauthorized agent self-invocation
- **Quality Gates**: Pre-commit hooks, YAML validation, security checks, and CI/CD enforcement
- **Zero-Tolerance Standards**: Comprehensive quality validation pipeline
- **Security-First Design**: Principle of least privilege with role-based access control

## üéØ Statusline Feature

The framework includes an **intelligent statusline** that provides real-time development context in your terminal. The statusline displays essential information at the bottom of your terminal session:

### Status Information Display
- **Claude Model**: Current model version (e.g., "claude-sonnet-4")
- **Git Branch**: Active branch name with repository context
- **Working Directory**: Current project path for quick reference  
- **Output Style**: Current formatting preference (markdown/plain)
- **Version Tracking**: Per-terminal version counter with visual indicators

### Per-Terminal Version Tracking ‚ú®
The statusline implements **intelligent per-terminal version tracking** using a ‚ú® star-based system:
- Each terminal session maintains its own version counter
- Stars (‚ú®) indicate Claude Code invocation frequency
- Visual progression shows development activity across sessions
- Helps track productivity and context switching between projects

### Robust Fallback Behavior
The statusline features **comprehensive error handling** for edge cases:
- **Empty Input**: Gracefully handles missing or invalid data from Claude Code
- **Git Errors**: Falls back to directory name when git operations fail
- **Path Resolution**: Handles complex directory structures and symbolic links
- **Terminal Compatibility**: Works across different terminal environments and shells

The statusline enhances developer awareness by providing contextual information without cluttering the workspace, enabling better focus and productivity during development sessions.

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Agent Not Found
```bash
# Check if configurations are synced
/sync

# Validate agent configurations
/agent-audit

# Check agent directory
ls ~/.claude/agents/
```

#### SYSTEM BOUNDARY Violation
If you see "SYSTEM BOUNDARY: operation not permitted":
- An agent attempted unauthorized self-invocation
- **Solution**: Let Claude handle all agent coordination
- This is a security feature, not an error

#### Configuration Sync Issues
```bash
# Ensure you're in the claude-config repository
pwd  # Should show .../claude-config

# Force sync with validation
/sync
```

#### Audio Notifications Not Working
```bash
# Check audio configuration
cat ~/.claude/settings.json | grep -A 10 "hooks"

# Test audio playbook
afplay /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/ToneLibrary.framework/Versions/A/Resources/AlertTones/Classic/Swish.m4r
```

## üîí Security

Security is fundamental to this framework:

### Built-in Security Features

- **SYSTEM BOUNDARY Protection**: Multi-layered prevention of unauthorized agent invocations
- **Sole Executor Model**: Only Claude has execution authority over agents
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal required permissions per specialist
- **Input Validation**: All inputs validated before processing
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all agent actions

### Security Policy

- **Vulnerability Reporting**: Use GitHub Security Advisories for private reporting
- **Response Timeline**: 24-48 hours for critical issues
- **Coordinated Disclosure**: Fixes deployed before public disclosure
- **No Stored Credentials**: Configuration files contain no secrets

See our [Security Policy](SECURITY.md) for complete details on reporting vulnerabilities and security best practices.

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: How do I deploy configurations from this repository?
**A:** Use the `/sync` command from within the claude-config repository. It validates and deploys all configurations to your `~/.claude/` directory with automatic backups.

### Q: How often should I update my configurations?
**A:** Run `git pull` in the claude-config repository periodically, then `/sync` to get the latest agent definitions, commands, and performance improvements.

### Q: What's the difference between repository CLAUDE.md and system-configs/CLAUDE.md?
**A:** The repository CLAUDE.md describes this configuration repository. The system-configs/CLAUDE.md is deployed to your home directory for global Claude configuration.

### Q: How do I know which agent to use for my task?
**A:** Check the [Agent Selection Guide](docs/development/AGENT_SELECTION_GUIDE.md) or use `/agent-audit` to see all available specialists with their capabilities.

### Q: Why did my agent task fail with "SYSTEM BOUNDARY" error?
**A:** This security feature prevents agents from invoking themselves or other agents. Always let Claude handle agent coordination - this is by design for security and consistency.

### Q: How can I contribute a new agent?
**A:** Use the template in `docs/agents/AGENT_TEMPLATE.md`, ensure valid YAML front-matter and SYSTEM BOUNDARY protection, validate with `./scripts/validate-agent-yaml.py`, then submit a PR.
