## üéØ Overview

The Claude Multi-Agent Orchestration System is a sophisticated AI-powered development ecosystem that coordinates **41 specialized agents** across 8 functional domains. By leveraging intelligent parallel execution and dynamic task decomposition, this system delivers comprehensive solutions faster and more effectively than any single agent could achieve.

### üåü What Makes This System Unique

This isn't just another AI tool‚Äîit's a complete paradigm shift in how complex technical work gets done:

- **Sole Executor Model**: Claude acts as the intelligent orchestrator, coordinating specialized agents who provide expertise while Claude maintains full execution control
- **Parallel-First Architecture**: Every task is analyzed for parallelization opportunities, dramatically reducing time-to-completion
- **SYSTEM BOUNDARY Protection**: Enhanced security model prevents unauthorized agent self-invocation or cross-agent communication
- **Multi-Instance Orchestration**: Run multiple instances of the same agent type for massive parallel operations

### Key Benefits

./scripts/validate_yaml.sh
```

### Test Coverage
- ‚úÖ Command validation
- ‚úÖ Configuration structure
- ‚úÖ Agent definition compliance
- ‚úÖ Integration workflows
- ‚úÖ YAML syntax validation

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Agent Not Found
```bash
# List all available agents
/agents list

# Search for specific capability
/agents suggest "database optimization"
```

#### SYSTEM BOUNDARY Violation
If you see "SYSTEM BOUNDARY: operation not permitted", this means:
- An agent attempted to invoke itself or another agent
- Solution: Let Claude handle all agent coordination

#### Audio Notifications Not Working
```bash
# Check audio hook configuration
cat ~/.claude/settings.json | grep -A 10 "hooks"

# Test audio playback
afplay /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/ToneLibrary.framework/Versions/A/Resources/AlertTones/Classic/Swish.m4r
```

#### Parallel Execution Not Happening
- Ensure you're using `/orchestrate` for complex tasks
- Check that tasks are truly independent
- Verify no sequential dependencies blocking parallelization

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: How do agents communicate with each other?
**A:** They don't! Claude is the sole orchestrator. Agents provide expertise and content, but Claude handles all execution and coordination.

### Q: Can I run multiple instances of the same agent?
**A:** Yes! This is a key feature. You can run multiple backend-engineers working on different services, multiple analysts examining different codebases, etc.

### Q: What's the difference between `/plan` and `/orchestrate`?
**A:** `/plan` creates a strategy without executing anything. `/orchestrate` actively coordinates agents to complete the task.

### Q: How do I know which agent to use?
**A:** Use `/agents suggest <task description>` or check our [Agent Selection Guide](docs/AGENT_SELECTION_GUIDE.md).

### Q: Why did my agent task fail with "SYSTEM BOUNDARY" error?
**A:** This security feature prevents agents from invoking themselves or other agents. Always let Claude handle agent coordination.

### Q: Can agents write files directly?
**A:** No. Agents generate content, Claude writes files. This maintains security and consistency.

### Q: How can I contribute a new agent?
**A:** Follow our agent template, ensure it includes SYSTEM BOUNDARY protection, and submit a PR. See [Contributing](#-contributing).

## üîí Security

- **SYSTEM BOUNDARY Protection**: Prevents unauthorized agent self-invocation
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Each agent has minimal required permissions
- **No Stored Credentials**: Configuration files contain no secrets
- **Regular Audits**: Use `/security` for comprehensive security assessments
- **Secure Orchestration**: Claude validates all agent operations
