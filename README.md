## üîß Troubleshooting & Support

### Common Installation Issues

#### `/sync` Command Not Found

```bash
# Ensure you're in the claude-config repository
pwd  # Should show path ending in claude-config
cd /path/to/claude-config
claude-code
/sync
```

#### Agent Not Found Errors

```bash
# Re-sync configurations
/sync

# Validate agent ecosystem
/agent-audit

# Check specific agent availability
ls ~/.claude/agents/ | grep agent-name
```

#### SYSTEM BOUNDARY Violations

This is a security feature, not an error:

- Agents cannot invoke themselves or other agents
- Only Claude has orchestration authority
- This protects against unauthorized recursion
- No action needed - system working correctly

#### Claude Code CLI Not Installed

```bash
# Install via npm
npm install -g @anthropic/claude-code

# Verify installation
claude-code --version

# If permission errors on npm install
sudo npm install -g @anthropic/claude-code
```

#### Configuration Directory Permissions

```bash
# Fix permissions if needed
chmod 755 ~/.claude
chmod 644 ~/.claude/agents/*
chmod 644 ~/.claude/commands/*
```

### Performance Optimization

```bash
# Monitor system performance
time /agent-audit    # Should be ~30-45 seconds
time /test          # Should be ~30-40 seconds
time /docs          # Should be ~1-2 minutes

# Run performance diagnostics
/agent-audit --debug
/test --verbose --performance
```

### Quality Gate Failures

```bash
# Fix common validation issues
./scripts/validate-markdown-quality.sh fix
./scripts/validate-agent-yaml.py --fix

# Re-run comprehensive validation
/test
/agent-audit

# NEVER bypass quality gates with --no-verify
```

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: How do I deploy configurations from this repository?

**A:** Use the `/sync` command from within the claude-config repository directory. It validates all
configurations and deploys them to your `~/.claude/` directory with automatic backup creation.

### Q: How often should I update my configurations?

**A:** Run `git pull` in the claude-config repository periodically to get the latest improvements, then use
`/sync` to deploy updates. Monthly updates are recommended for optimal performance and security.

### Q: What's the difference between the repository files and deployed configurations?

**A:** The repository contains source configurations and documentation. The `/sync` command deploys the
production-ready configurations from `system-configs/.claude/` to your `~/.claude/` directory for global access.

### Q: How do I know which agent to use for my specific task?

**A:** Check the [Agent Selection Guide](docs/development/AGENT_SELECTION_GUIDE.md) for detailed guidance, or
use `/agent-audit` to see all 28 available specialists with their capabilities and categories.

### Q: Why did my agent task fail with "SYSTEM BOUNDARY" error?

**A:** This security feature prevents agents from invoking themselves or other agents. Always let Claude handle
agent coordination and orchestration - this is by design for security and consistency.

### Q: How can I contribute a new agent to the ecosystem?

**A:** Use the comprehensive template in `docs/agents/AGENT_TEMPLATE.md`, ensure valid YAML front-matter and
SYSTEM BOUNDARY protection, validate with `./scripts/validate-agent-yaml.py`, then submit a Pull Request.

### Q: What performance improvements should I expect after installation?

**A:** Expect 4-6x performance improvements: `/agent-audit` (30-45 sec), `/test` (30-40 sec), `/docs` (1-2 min),
`/prime` (15-20 sec) through intelligent parallel execution and multi-instance orchestration.

### Q: Can I use this with my existing Claude Code CLI setup?

**A:** Yes! The `/sync` command creates automatic backups before deployment. Your existing configurations are
preserved and can be restored if needed.

### Q: What if I only want specific agents or commands?

**A:** Use Option 2: Custom Installation to selectively install components. You can copy only the agents or
commands you need from `system-configs/.claude/`.
