## üéØ Overview

This repository delivers a **sophisticated Smart Agent Orchestration Framework** for Claude Code CLI, featuring
**41 specialized agents** (including execution-evaluator for command verification) and
**18 essential commands** (including the new command-audit for command ecosystem validation).
Built from the ground up after a comprehensive cleanup that removed 85+ bloat files, this system provides intelligent
task delegation, parallel execution, continuous improvement capabilities, and automatic command verification for
enhanced development workflows.

## üß† Smart Agent Orchestration Framework

This repository implements a **production-ready orchestration framework** that intelligently manages 41 specialized
agents with sophisticated task delegation and parallel execution capabilities.

### üåü Framework Core Principles

#### üéØ Right Tool for the Job

- **Mandatory Specialist Delegation**: When a specialist exists, USE THEM - violation equals execution failure
- **Domain Expertise**: Each agent has deep specialization in their domain
- **Quality Boundaries**: Specialists maintain higher standards than generalist approaches

#### ‚ö° Parallel-First Execution

- **Concurrent by Default**: Multiple agents work simultaneously whenever possible
- **Intelligent Coordination**: Framework optimizes task distribution and dependencies
- **Multi-Instance Support**: Run multiple instances of the same agent type for massive parallelization

#### üìä Pragmatic Thresholds

- **Emergency Override**: Direct action when specialists aren't available or time-critical
- **Context-Aware Decisions**: Framework balances specialist deployment vs. direct execution
- **Performance Feedback Loop**: Continuous improvement based on execution metrics

#### üîÑ Continuous Improvement

- **Performance Monitoring**: Tracks execution times, success rates, and quality metrics
- **Adaptive Allocation**: Learns optimal agent combinations for common task patterns
- **Quality Evolution**: Agent capabilities improve through validated feedback cycles

### Key Framework Benefits

- **üé≠ 41 Specialized Agents**: Complete coverage across 8 functional domains
- **‚ö° Parallel Execution Engine**: Maximize concurrent operations for faster delivery
- **üß† Intelligent Task Delegation**: Automatic specialist selection based on task requirements
- **üîÑ One-Command Synchronization**: Deploy entire framework with `/sync`
- **üõ°Ô∏è Quality Enforcement**: YAML validation, SYSTEM BOUNDARY protection, and compliance checking
- **üìö Comprehensive Documentation**: 26 essential documentation files with usage patterns
- **üîß 18 Essential Commands**: Carefully curated for maximum operational utility
- **üéØ Production-Ready**: Battle-tested configurations with quality gates and security boundaries

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Agent Not Found

```bash
# Check if configurations are synced
/sync

# Run agent audit to validate configurations
/agent-audit

# Check agent directory
ls ~/.claude/agents/
```

#### SYSTEM BOUNDARY Violation

If you see "SYSTEM BOUNDARY: operation not permitted", this means:

- An agent attempted to invoke itself or another agent
- Solution: Let Claude handle all agent coordination

#### Audio Notifications Not Working

```bash
# Check audio hook configuration
cat ~/.claude/settings.json | grep -A 10 "hooks"

# Test audio playbook
afplay /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/ToneLibrary.framework/Versions/A/Resources/AlertTones/Classic/Swish.m4r
```

#### Configuration Sync Issues

```bash
# Ensure you're in the claude-config repository
pwd  # Should show .../claude-config

# Check repository status
git status

# Force sync with validation
/sync
```

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: How do I deploy configurations from this repository?

**A:** Use the `/sync` command from within the claude-config repository. It will validate and deploy all
configurations to your `~/.claude/` directory.

### Q: How often should I update my configurations?

**A:** Run `git pull` in the claude-config repository periodically, then `/sync` to get the latest agent
definitions and commands.

### Q: What's the difference between the repository CLAUDE.md and system-configs/CLAUDE.md?

**A:** The repository CLAUDE.md describes this configuration repository. The system-configs/CLAUDE.md is deployed
to your home directory for global Claude configuration.

### Q: How do I know which agent to use?

**A:** Check the [Agent Selection Guide](docs/AGENT_SELECTION_GUIDE.md) or use `/agent-audit` to see all
available agents.

### Q: Why did my agent task fail with "SYSTEM BOUNDARY" error?

**A:** This security feature prevents agents from invoking themselves or other agents. Always let Claude handle
agent coordination.

### Q: Can agents write files directly?

**A:** No. Agents generate content, Claude writes files. This maintains security and consistency.

### Q: How can I contribute a new agent?

**A:** Use the template in `system-configs/.claude/agents/AGENT_TEMPLATE.md`, ensure valid YAML front-matter and
SYSTEM BOUNDARY protection, then submit a PR.

## üîí Security & Framework Protection

- **Enhanced SYSTEM BOUNDARY Protection**: Multi-layered prevention of unauthorized agent self-invocation
- **Orchestration Security**: Framework-level validation of all agent operations and task delegation
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Each specialist has minimal required permissions with role-based access
- **No Stored Credentials**: Configuration files contain no secrets, security through architecture
- **Continuous Security Monitoring**: Automated security assessments via the security-auditor agent
- **Production-Ready Security Gates**: Comprehensive security validation throughout the orchestration pipeline
