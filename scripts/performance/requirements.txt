# High-Performance Script Dependencies
# ====================================
# 
# Required dependencies for performance-optimized scripts:
# - Async file operations with aiofiles
# - System monitoring with psutil
# - Memory profiling support
# - High-performance data processing

# Async I/O operations
aiofiles>=23.1.0

# System monitoring and process management  
psutil>=5.9.0

# Memory profiling (built-in tracemalloc is used, but psutil provides additional metrics)

# Standard library modules used (no additional dependencies):
# - asyncio (built-in)
# - concurrent.futures (built-in) 
# - hashlib (built-in)
# - json (built-in)
# - re (built-in)
# - time (built-in)
# - pathlib (built-in)
# - dataclasses (built-in Python 3.7+)
# - typing (built-in Python 3.5+)
# - logging (built-in)

# Development and testing dependencies (optional)
# pytest>=7.0.0  # For additional testing
# pytest-asyncio>=0.21.0  # For async test support
